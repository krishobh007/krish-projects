I'm planning on getting German on january after im done with french :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow you almost done, I am on Level 2 Unit 2 La Spanish and I had to ask some people just to get an understanding of it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I grew up speaking Spanish; I'd be happy to help you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to speak 6 of them fluently.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to speak 4.5 of them fluently, I am not sure if I should give Chinese a try or not.####$$##%POSITIVE
Remembering the Kana (Katakana & Hiragana), and Remembering the Kanji (Volumes 1-3), all by Heisig. Best method I've ever seen for learning them. I was able to learn 100 kanji in one day, and recall them nearly perfectly. Highly recommended.####$$##%POSITIVE
So am I, after I learn #4 then I am going to learn #8, and then I dont know the next one I want to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
It depends on you, I usually spend about 1 to 2 hrs on RS a day. Thats the good thing about RS, you can go at your own pace.####$$##%POSITIVE
I do way more than 30 minutes. I do a lesson/activity during the day and one at night. i've studied japanese before so i already know a lot. i have done the units more than once.####$$##%POSITIVE
it's fairly accurate. of course you learn much faster over there but rosetta stone is by far the best program out there####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm using it and it works a hell of a lot better than reading books or trying to learn it as a grammatically structured program, (like they teach languages in school) although for me it helps that i already know Japanese pretty well...but Rosetta stone taught me that too!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Tony, my degree is in East Asian Studies, specifically 中国文化 (Chinese Culture), and RS is a large part of how I actually learned Chinese. It's a very good tool to have in your toolkit.####$$##%POSITIVE
Tony, yes, I was studying in university. IMO language learning is not about how many words you memorize, especially if you can't use them. When you say you understand "how the language works" what do you mean? You're comfortable with double 了? you are comfortable with the 把 structure? You are comfortable with verbal compliments? Do you mean you fully understand and can use the grammar of the language effectively in communication? Or just that you're abstractly comfortable with the idea that it's largely an SVO language? In my experience, RS is the best way to get to an intermediate level in the language...by real-world, not school, standards.####$$##%POSITIVE
There are many benefits to learning Arabic but one of the best of them all is being able to watch this exciting history a little more closely.   Every time they show some graffiti scattered wall or a demonstration with signs, in the news of the Middle East, my ability to read Arabic improves.  To those wondering what languages to study ... consider that there are more changes to come and you can understand and feel this history far better if you know what people are saying.  Furthermore, it is frequently not what is being reported.   Some of major media outlets here are completely out to lunch both culturally and linguistically.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like Rosetta Stone, don't get me wrong, but the truth is, that you will most likely not be able to understand Arabic news programs, neither on television nor newspapers, with only the Rosetta Stone training under your belt.  That being said, I think the Rosetta Stone studios do a really good job in preparing students for real life conversations... which who knows, might lead to full fluency eventually.  Personally, I find Rosetta Stone Arabic too simple now, and I've actually jumped ship to the Arab Academy in order to get some more advanced training.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jon - I agree that the RS course is not enough alone to understand Arabic News programs.  I didn't say it was.   What it did do is give me the ability to read Arabic on signs and graffiti and remember what was written. It gave me the ability to hear Arabic and make a good guess of how the word was written.  So, I can expand my vocabulary as needed.  That capability is something you get from RS.    Part of this has to do with the nature of Arabic writing, but then I was able to find out what I read or heard where they were new words.     With RS, I have been able to pick up part of the conversation.   I have also been able to go beyond the RS course in ways that would have been impossible without first taking the RS course.   I do think that RS is a beginning for a serious language learner, not the end.  In fact, English is my first language and I'm still getting new words.  My new English word was: vaticinate ... one can not really vaticinate what will happen in the Middle east but it helps to know some Arabic.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have changed in the past my computer's interface (menus, messages, etc.), and also my Facebook interface, to the language I'm learning. I found both to be very helpful in further learning my new language. Regarding Studio sessions, just relax and do your best. Sessions are not practical tests; rather, they are a living lab where the coach helps you practice what you have learned, helps you loosen up your tongue, and even teaches you a few new words. Enjoy!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's the complete oposite from english, and it's gonna be a fun adventure for a first time second language :) Have fun! I am :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I would say learn the Japanese syllabic alphabet system, Kana. Hiragana and Katakana. It's easy to learn and jumpstarts your reading skills. If you have an iPod touch or iPhone, there is an app game called kana that is very effective :)####$$##%POSITIVE
The whole setting has been gone in V4 (in the Portuguese course); it was there in V3. I understand there is an app update for OS X coming up; hopefully then the setting will be back.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok! Maybe I should stop being so hard on myself. :) Games does sound like a good idea. haha Thanks for that Anne-Marie!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've found too that those times that are most frustrating, perhaps even messing up what I used to be able to do are actually times when I learn the most. When I push through, I often find that I make a real leap in ability.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you very much! that was really quick!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Stick with it; trust the process. This learning method is one where learning seems slow at first, and then one day it all comes together, and "click", you realize how much you know.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone's customer service is an inspiration to me as a design student learning Service Design :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have a lot of Spanish books, and did learn over the years, but RS provides the most gains for me. Good Luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Jen! It seems difficult to learn a language. I have the alphabet down the colors and the basic convo stuff. I feel this will help advance my career. When you know a foreign language it is like you automatically get a job.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, when you know a foreign language, it changes things. Yes, learning another language is not all fun and games, but well worth the effort.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ashleigh: In my application, Version 4 (4.0.22 - 38345) for OS X, and in my course, Portuguese (Brazil) Level 2 v 3.7.5.2. r2, there is no such option. I have a screen shot that I'd like to send to you; how may I get it to you? Thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would like to know how much the package costs and what is the percent of users whom actually learn spanish ####$$##%POSITIVE
First, you can see the prices on their web site at http://rosettastone.com .    The % of people is not as important as the % of you. It is what you bring to it,  not how others did. This is why they provide a six month no questions asked return policy *IF* you buy it direct (not from a book store).  If after six months you are not really into it ... you never will be and so return it and get your money back.  If you give it the time (about 4-5 hours a week) then you will find this is easy and really effective.  No strain, you just learn.   You will see how it works for yourself.   Having had years of college language class, this is better.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the Korean RS and I feel that I've learned more and I've learned better using other sources besides RS. I feel that, for me, RS is an expensive way to review, but not all that great at actually teaching. Most people on this page will tell you how wonderful it is, though.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, Thank YOU, Rosetta Stone® <3####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks so much for ur help im a serious beginner at korean but its the most important to me to learn i wanna learn it so bad so thanks 4 u comment and honesty!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
ok, thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, both of you!####$$##%POSITIVE
that's amazing!  i hope I learn that quickly!  I'm going to be starting Spanish Level 1 next week :D####$$##%POSITIVE
It takes about 40-50 hours per level.  Some languages have 3 and others 5 levels.   I'd say that about 40 minutes a day and longer sessions a day or two a week so you have about 5 hours a week  is a good pace though some people do it more intensely.   It definitely is better than a classroom for picking up a new language.  If you put in the time, you will succeed.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the comments####$$##%POSITIVE
how did u learn korean btw if u dnt mind telling me how it taught u korean (not rs)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes. If there are any problems, you can call tech support.####$$##%POSITIVE
really? it really works this is important to me and i don't have crazy kinds of money.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have German and Italian and it has given me a good base to continue.  I want to learn other languages, and I find that it is an economical way to get the basics.  College classes are more expensive and not as individualized -you can't go back as often as you need, and many classes don't give you a great deal of time to actually speak the language.   IMHO, If you are taking a language that uses a different writing system, you may want to know how to read it and use it before going to RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got RS when I was an absolute beginner [well almost, I could kind of read Hangul though my reading speed was slow] and at first it was nearly impossible for me to get through it and learn from it. I couldn't remember anything I learned and nothing was sticking. I remember the only things I could remember were man, woman, apple, milk, and eating rice/a meal [which, at the time, I thought meant "eating" in general and had no idea why they included the 밥을 part, but now I understand that], even though I was through with all of unit 1 [which contains a lot more than that]. I could somewhat easily get the questions right when using the program, but I could hardly remember anything when I wasn't using it. Now, I still learn almost completely on my own [no college courses available in Korean where I live]. I use a mixture of free podcasts [you can message me if you want a link, I'm not going to advertise on RS's page], a flashcard program [for reviewing sentence structures and for learning vocab, I feel like I learn vocab very quickly with flashcards but other people aren't the same way], and textbooks that I've purchased. I also watch a lot of Korean shows and listen to Korean music to practice hearing the sounds and to try to pick up what I understand just by listening. Lately, I've been posting 1 tweet a day in Korean on Twitter to practice writing, because I was lacking in writing practice. There are a lot of sources to learn Korean for free if you don't want to spend money on an expensive program. The main thing I lack now is speaking to an actual person, which is something RS v4 does help you with if I understand correctly. But I've felt that actually learning to understand Korean has been easier and more effective on my own than with RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also I want to say that this is simply my experience. Other people have used RS and really liked it. I just think you need to be skeptical and look into your many options before making such a huge purchase, especially since you're young and probably would be spending your parents money rather than your own. ^^####$$##%POSITIVE
rosetta has a money back guarantee, you should try it ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't progress with Spanish until I purchased RS.  I love RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, when you are an absolute beginner, it helps to know the alphabet. RS goes at a quick pace, so it may be overwhelming for some.  In level 2, they go into the past and future tenses.  This may be a lot for anyone who is not adequately prepared (can't  read the script).  RS strives to teach conversational fluency.  There is a 5 payment plan and a 6 month guarantee meaning that you can send it back with 6 months of purchasing it and receive your money back. Also, if there is a kiosk or store near your house, you may want to go there and look at the software and get some further information before you purchase.####$$##%POSITIVE
thx to all!!! this relly helped Sarah Bokunic i really appreciate it (ur probably right about the mney) if u dont mind ill message u for the links plzz !####$$##%POSITIVE

Level 2, Unit 4, Lesson 2 (Portuguese) just completed. Also, someone pointed me to educational TV programs on-line from Brazil, and I am immensely enjoying watching them, both for their educational content, and because I am amazed at how much I understand. Educational programs, as compared to drama shows (i.e. "prime time TV"), are better to watch; the language used is usually higher quality, and the participants usually speak slower and cleaner.  I recommend looking up the equivalent of PBS shows in the country/countries that speak the language that you are learning. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's ridiculously addictive! Absolutely love it####$$##%POSITIVE
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER CROATIAN?? PLEASE SOON!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yea, it is hard to explain to people that I know far more French from using RS for just a few months compared to my two years in French during high school - but we went at a verrrryy slow pace, it was hard to retain anything and we only met 1-2 times a week. Not surprising to hear that 3 levels is 6 years :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Im doing pretty great. It's just there's some words i dont understand and it doesn't show you the phrase in english on the rosetta stone im using.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The phrase that i learned so far is that is better for me to use studio all through 5 levels and practice it too that helps improve also with the coach. Thanks for the advice tracie probadly i could ask you for help, thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
@Francesco, it did for me. I became conversational in japanese after a few months.####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice im gunna start studying hard these few months!####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay im starting to remember them by the pictures, but i dont know what the hell they mean?! Except for the numbers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Patience. It's learning by association.####$$##%POSITIVE
Repetition is a good thing...short term memory fools you into thinking you know it...####$$##%POSITIVE
Not a bad plan but RS is a great complement to that plan.  It's not either or.  With RS you will get moving very fast, you might be able to skip the first year or two of the college course and move on to the literature and culture aspects which are more appropriate to college.   RS is very good at getting you moving but does not teach technical grammar, culture or literature.    Point out to your Dad that if you buy from RS direct (not a book store) you have six months to return it no questions asked and a full refund.  So suggest he buy the software and then if you can't prove to his total satisfaction that it was worth it in that time, return it.####$$##%POSITIVE
And I still say they should offer students an discount!####$$##%NEGATIVE
approx 81 dollars a month under the five month plan for the full pack, not bad.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey, you can do both(if you have the finances to do so). What so special about RS is that you can think in your new language(immersion).####$$##%POSITIVE
what about a children's beginning class also.....a discount for seniors would be great....too much right now....government almost shut down...help####$$##%NEGATIVE

Payment plan for people other than the us. I wanted to do that at first but couldn't as I'm Canadian. I bought it anyways but I bought it much later than I wanted to####$$##%NEGATIVE
When are you going to offer Hungarian??####$$##%NEGATIVE
There are meetups all over the country that have Japanese conversation with native speakers.  Go on SKYPE, there are always people looking to swap their language with English. See if there are any Japanese organizations in your town that would welcome a person interested in improving Japanese language and learning the culture.  Most people are flattered when you want to learn their language.  I am starting level 5 of German, and I actually had a SKYPE class with a guy in Germany.  It so happens that I had just finished learning the vocabulary with RS, so I felt really good about it.  IMHO, the biggest fear is actually speaking the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
for english####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for your help- that explains why she can't find it on the Spanish version of your web site. :) I'll let her know.   Keep up the great work on your software! In two months I've nearly completed all of level one Spanish (Spain) and I can't wait to get into level two. I had an earlier version of your product to learn Swedish several years ago, and your TOTALe product has come a long way since then. I thought the product was great back then- I'm absolutely astonished at how much better it is now. This is one very happy language learner. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I cannot open the program at all now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your great help!  Alex is excellent, he fixed it! (So is Vijay and John)   Quick and attentive help!####$$##%POSITIVE
That was so awesome. Rosetta Stone is a beautifully integrated multifaceted learning package.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
That is why I chose Rosetta Stone. My brain injury (also from a motorcycle accident) I 6 years old now, and I can still only remember the last 3 months. I'm hoping RS will help my brain function. I was a Russian linguist for the Army, so this is not my first time studying a foreign language. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your support and the article, Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
But what language am I supposed to be typing in?  English, to help my partner, or Spanish, to help me?  And why would the program pair a level one student with an advanced student?####$$##%NEGATIVE
*It doesn't appear like russian is listed as a language.####$$##%POSITIVE
For a company that promotes language products,  you do a very poor job of attempting to communicate in English, in writing!  Get it right!  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Then you get no support or Audio companion. Bad idea####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rs can send you a link for an Arabic demo.  You should ask tomorrow.####$$##%POSITIVE
Arjun, using Torrents is not "Lol" - it is a felony and with RS, you will be caught.   It's dumb because they have a free demo from their web site and, if you buy direct from RS, you can return it within six months for a full no questions asked refund.  I've used Arabic and I loved it.  I'm going on to more advanced levels now.####$$##%POSITIVE

Obviously I am NOT making my self clear so I can going to try this AGAIN...under EDIT PROFILE, LANGUAGE SETTINGS, ADD LANGUAGE TO PRACTICE there are 21 languages from which to pic...Shall I list all 21?  SWEDISH IS NOT A CHOICE AT ALL in the ADD LANGUAGE TO PRACTICE!  My question is...FOR THE 4th TIME...IS SWEDISH NOT A LANGUAGE CHOICE under LANGUAGE SETTINGS for RWorld,com?  Please, I implore you, to LOOK at RWorld and see for yourself what I am asking.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Angel -- if you do, let us know how it goes!  I KNOW it's going to be difficult, but I'll keep Rosetta updated. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Danish, Dari, Indonesian, Latin, Pashto, Portuguese, Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Urdu and Welsh are the languages in RWorld that are NOT available under the pull down menu for ADD LANGUAGE.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Why would I register with a new email if I am MISSING 11 languages??????####$$##%NEGATIVE
Check with your libraries and with your school. They may have online versions you can use.   Also you can buy RS on 5 interest free payments and you can return it within six months if you buy direct from RS (not a bookstore) .   My suggestion is that ask your family to buy it and if you don't show good progress in six months they can get their money back.  If you put in a good pace of about 5 hours a week, you should be more proficient than other kids starting out with just school.  If you talk to the language teachers at your school, they may want to try this experiment too because RS relieves them of the more tedious parts of their job and lets them concentrate on the parts that are fun for them and students such as literature.   Generally speaking, most deep discounts on RS are phoney and will rip you off.  So be very careful if the discount is more than 10% or so and not from RS direct.  Watch this site because sometimes they offer discounts for a few weeks.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, me and my friend are thinking about going to Europe next year for an educational program. We've been talking about me using RS for a while and we've decided on either French or Italian.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have three languages, please enlighten me as to why I need to have 3 different emails for RWorld yet I can switch between all three languages and play the games and read the stories on Rosetta Stone.  I must have seriously missed something when I bought this software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey Jennifer, I would but Swedish is not coming up in the drag down menu, only 21 languages are coming down.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I know. I have a lesson down and I walk away for and hour and forget some of the things I learned...Sooo frustrating:)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats for the pick me up though:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, go to the RS endangered language programs page, find out what the tribal organization is which worked on developing the course. They own it and would probably be delighted to sell you a copy.  I don't think it has anything to do with where you live.####$$##%POSITIVE
And it makes me hungry because of all of the food examples:)####$$##%POSITIVE
You'll get used to them.  I recently went to a Chinese restaurant and was surprised I could read some of the signs especially since I was taking Japanese class.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do you know of their 5 part 0% interest payment program?   As comparable levels of language learning go, it's actually not that expensive.   Also, watch this site because from time to time, they have a sale.####$$##%POSITIVE
It will get more involved, so you might long for the days of repetition. Maybe not. I remember the day when it got more involved for me.  I sat up straight in my chair, and knew I was on to something good.  Remember to pace yourself.####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, there are a lot of average people who do the 5-payment plan, or just charge it because they really want/need to learn.  You can learn at your own pace, and it is a lot cheaper than attending a college class (tuition, books, transportation, etc.). Also, there isn't any grade pressure.####$$##%POSITIVE
Compared with other software programs it's expensive; compared with private classes or even group classes (I work at a language school) it's not.  I'm impressed with it, frankly.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the quick response! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
cool thanks   :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just went for it  and booked two recently Im far from perfect. but you get better and the Native speakers in the sesion are  patient and helpfull####$$##%POSITIVE
unless you are a natural savant this is the normal learning curve.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's normal.  The point of online coaching is not to show off what you know but to practice and perfect your skill.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, it is normal.  The coaches are extremely patient, and I am sure that there are other students who have the same doubts.  You have to keep going.  There will be days when you excel and other days when you feel like it is all a waste (I had one of those in studio today!), you have to keep going and you will really surprise yourself in the log run!####$$##%POSITIVE
OK, well I've found the Arabic course to be great.  Of the relevant skills, I think the ability to read phonetically was the strongest soonest. However, Arabic is almost a perfect 1:1 relationship between character + accents and sound.####$$##%POSITIVE
Because it is so good.####$$##%POSITIVE
Agreed! Also, I didn't know you could do the unit session multiple times - that's great to know!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Välkommen till svenksa!  I am on Level 2 Unit 1 right now.  I really have to work on Swedish.  I used RS for Spanish and Portuguese and felt very comfortable from the beginning but that is not the case with Swedish even though the grammar is much easier.  The more Studios you take will boost your confidence.  Also, you may not always click with a Studio coach.  We all have our favorites.  That is just part of the learning.  BTW...keep your eye out for Jimmy.  He is really excellent.####$$##%POSITIVE
One last thing...passive language acquisition/recognition is always easier than active language/recall...it will come in time.  Aim for short sentences.####$$##%POSITIVE
Remember when we all purchased computers we couldn't afford?  We did it anyway, for whatever reason. We somehow found the money for this.  I am referring to the time when computers were well over a grand. We should all do the same for learning another language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Expensive? Rosetta Stone is cheaper than just about any other product or language-learning service on the market.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool! I'm learning German at the moment and planning to do Russian next too!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I'll be ordering RS for the first time this month and I can't wait.####$$##%POSITIVE
It took me about almost 4 years to get through all the levels. It was very difficult, but worth the while.####$$##%POSITIVE
100% Rosetta####$$##%POSITIVE
If you compare what you will learn for the price with RS to what it costs in a college language course (you will need at least two semesters) ... it's not expensive.   It is guaranteed, if you sign up at a college and don't show up, can't show up or whatever - tough.  This system is more effective, takes less time and is more flexible to your schedule.  With all that, it is not expensive - it is effective.####$$##%POSITIVE
I know that one. I practised a bit of Farsi with a few people, and there are some who practised English with me (since I'm an ESL teacher). I was just sharing about the attitude of some people I encountered. That's all. :)####$$##%NEGATIVE

No, I dont learn a language with Rosetta yet, but I am well on the way to. Today I purchased the Rosetta Stone online course in Vietnamese and I am just fascinated. I have read lots of psycholoy-books from NLP to through 'Vera F.Birkenbihls method of learning a foreign language for students', and it seems to me, that Rosetta has taken the best parts out of it and invented a system to teach people a language in the most elementary and easiest way. It is stunning how fast you can make progress. I hope that -with that method- my long-term memory keeps most of it. We'll see, but i'm quite confident it will. But one thing that disturbs me, and I have to mention is the price of Rosetta Stone. The high quality of the online courses ( and I am sure as well the program-courses ) stays in the direct contrast with the user acceptance. Or maybe it should be in this way? Maybe to create a elite of language-nerds? :-) No seriously, I can imagine, that the number of sales would explode, if the price of Rosetta would be 30%-40% lower. It would probably be a way to convince more people of Rosetta.  In the words of Martin Kessel "Wer eine Fremdsprache lernt, zieht den Hut vor einer anderen Nation." means paraphrased "Those who learn a foreign language, are those, who pull off ones hat to another nation."  PS: I hope that the quote makes sense translated :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE

Philosophies vary.  I suggest you play and find out.  The two basic views seem to be perfect before you move on and the second, my favorite, "load up and keep moving until you go nuts ... then back up".  You can mix and match depending on your mood.####$$##%POSITIVE

Well then deb you don't have to "like" them if you don't like their advertising. Rosetta Stone is a company trying to make money and in today's world that means being on Facebook to advertise.  Btw in don't work for them i only use their products. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck Allison on learning french! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Way to  Jill  I love doing them####$$##%POSITIVE
Way to go I mean####$$##%POSITIVE
I always get nervous before studios, but they are soo much fun, relaxed and we always laugh alot.  Afterwards, I'm ready to immiediately sign up for another one!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ciao a tutti!  The small description on the blog  is not accurate.  I am studying Italian -- not French!  I could not love the process more.  Wishing you good luck in your own language journey!  (PS:  I hope it's Italian!)  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
PS:  Thanks for the shout out, RS!####$$##%POSITIVE
Have fun Allison! I will be reviewing my italian next with RS! There is a Rosetta Stone Italian Group here on fb. You could join them if you want.####$$##%POSITIVE
WHAT?!!!  That is great to hear!  I'm all over it!  Thanks Jennifer!####$$##%POSITIVE
But wait!  I can't find you guys!  Would you be kind enough to post a link to your page?  Grazie mille, A.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good job, Jennifer! How are you getting along in the studio sessions? What kinds of activities do you do at Level 2? I just had my first and it was a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to moving beyond "What is this? This is X. Do you have an X?" :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
The activities are very different in Level 2. The Studio sessions in Level 2 are more conversational than the studio sessions in Level 1. In the reading courses, you need to read the sentence(the voice does not read it for you) and click the picture that corresponds to the sentence. You will face those changes  starting a Unit 4.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm tracking the package on UPS, lol.  I'm so impatient ^_^####$$##%POSITIVE
yep. I have never studied japanese in a classroom setting but I learned those-masu forms.####$$##%POSITIVE
You can use Rosetta Stone whenever you want####$$##%POSITIVE
I just finished Rosetta Stone Level 2 as well! I'm taking Level 3 with me to The University of Tennessee where I am majoring in Linguistics with a concentration in Japanese! All thanks to Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just go through one language at a time with RS. RS, offers 5 payment plans for just under $100 a month(for 5 months)####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to be sponsored by them to document my experience. Can't do more payment plans... I am married and we can't afford anything extra.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great Job Jennifer.  I'm still on Level 1 and I already love it.  I cannot wait to make it to level 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
how exactly do you send an invitation?  I've been in Simbio and I don't see an invitation button for example.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Grazie! I really want to vacation in Italy in the not too distant future.  I'm also playing with the idea of working some summers there, tutoring English students once my kids are out of school. My main concern at this point is that my computer might crash once I download the software. Is it possible to re-load it if that happens?####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I saw they have a new blogger who is going to be learning Italian. I am assuming they're giving her their program free in exchange for the publicity spread through her blog. I want to do that also, I would love to learn ANY language. Top picks would be French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Russian.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Anne-Marie; I've been taking Rosetta Stone French level 1 for a little while and believe me I love the studio sessions. I usually take two or three per week and I learn something new everytime. Your confidence grows with each session. Best wishes!####$$##%POSITIVE
What I meant was, I already have the French course but will finish it soon and would like to be able to extend it and keep learning new things using the Rosetta stone method. After French I'm gonna learn Spanish. Probably in the new year!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
This is the best program. I'm with french and I'm very happy.####$$##%POSITIVE
I also was wondering if there might be a level 6 for some of the languages.... in my case, Spanish Latin America.  For when I get to that point, of course!####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 6 German bitte schön!!! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Grammatically, it is more difficult.  Germany, Austria, and Switzerland are culturally fascinating to me.  So, I learn German and Italian, and improve my French!####$$##%NEGATIVE
See RS! It's not just me! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Just as a comment, I think it would be extremely helpful. I would say that rounding out your study with technical things such as grammar and then studying some of the literature are the next steps.   I am sure it is helpful, very helpful but, I think that different schools have different educational goals and so it is probably best to discuss it with the instructors there.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool. Thank you. I do like the websites too but nothing beats the normal lessons!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congratulations! from your message it appears you are learning the language very well!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Geoffrey, Actually I can write good enough,  but I can't speak fluently, and RS is helping me to get better!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congratz on trying to learn our language!####$$##%POSITIVE
I believe that Rosetta Stone has a contract with the Military and if you are in active service you can use their software for free.  I think they have posted the link here but it is at an online education portal.  For family, I think it is discounted at the PX.####$$##%POSITIVE
Geoffrey you are correct!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Sarah. But actually, I wasn't working very hard; rather, I wasn't working at all. There was a distraction in my life, which is now over, so I am back to investing my time in my Portuguese studies, and feeling very happy about it! I even bought some more Studio time, as the time that came with my V4 product expired (and went unused, unfortunately for me). Thanks again for your support, though.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much.....going to check it out!!####$$##%POSITIVE
It took me three years for five levels ONLY because I was in school and didn't do it every day all the time diligently.  It all depends on how fast you learn, but it could easily be done in a year if you kept a steady pace. :) I think your daughter could learn as long as she can tell what is happening in the pictures. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
First thing to know is that the Army provides this to soldiers free at the learning portal.  Next, there are deep discounts for family at the PX.   To your question, the German course is 5 levels. (others only 3)  Each level takes about 40-50 hours to get through all the material in that level. Then there is practice and review.   After about 40 hours and effort though you will have the beginning of an ability to get around and convey basic points.  It then keeps getting better with each level.  That you are in country is going to be a really huge advantage for you and well before you get even half way through, your knowledge from RS will lead you to pick things up that are not even in the course.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome. Thank you guys. I think my husband was gonna get them from ako. Not sure though. We can't wait.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think that RS offers Croatian ( or Serbian, for that matter).####$$##%NEGATIVE
3 levels is $399 and 5 levels $499.  I have German, and it has helped me a lot.  I want to be able to speak better in my German classes.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's worth doing, even when it sometimes does not go well.  What were the delays?####$$##%POSITIVE
Curious did you use the headset and microphone that RS provided you?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not sure what the delay was. The screen said it was connecting but it just wasn't doing it. I contacted technical support and they told me to log out and then back in. That worked but then the audio was coming out of my speakers instead of the headset (yes, RS's). I went back and fixed that but then I already felt a little overwhelmed coming in late that I just ended the session. I may try again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do that quite frequently but my laptop can still be a bit slugglish at times.####$$##%NEGATIVE
don't give up!! studio sessions are gr8, every once in a while there may be a glitch but the coaches and tech support try hard to help. I've been doing them since June and so far never had a problem. the coaches are very patient####$$##%POSITIVE
@Taylor - If true, that's a sad comment on software quality.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have found that when I'm wireless and do a session I have problems but when I'm connected thru ethernet cable I have no issues at all...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Don't get discouraged because the studios are an invaluable help in learning the language. The tech support is very good and will work with you until your problem is solved. Contact them.####$$##%POSITIVE
Fantastico!####$$##%POSITIVE
Contact tech support - after installing the update for my Mac, I got an error as well, not sure if the same solution will work for you, but tech support just had me go to rosettastone.com/v4upgrade and everything worked fine after I installed the update from there####$$##%POSITIVE
In level 4, we spend a lot of time being asked to recognize flags such as from countries from Sengal. What real importance does this have? We could be practicing the verb system while using new nouns at the same time. To me this lesson was a big waste of my time and very disappointing to be the last lesson. The level 3  guides given to the coaches should be written in a way that we get to practice subjunctives, past tenses , future, etc. I calculate that I have done at least 136 lessons as there are about 34 lessons in each one of the four units that comprise each unit. I really think 136 lessons later, I should be working with all of the tenses that were presented during this course. I don't want to answer What is this city. It is Venice. I should be answering questions such as if you were to go  to Venice tomorrow, what would you do. You need to revamp these lessons big time. It is a disgrace to have us on a studio still working in the present tense on the last lesson. Judy Friedkin####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have not experienced that with my Italian coaches, I'm currently finishing Level 2 and we are already making up stories about the pictures we see, and practicing present, past and future tenses, so much so that i really work on my verbs because i know the coaches will be asking####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow, that is interesting. One of my coaches does that but the others follow their guide. I think it is so important to make up stories and not just answer questions with a couple of words.  I do love my coaches, though!####$$##%POSITIVE
I know just how you feel Chris! I got my Rosetta Stone Deutsch Monday and I've been at it non-stop! I've been tempted to play hooky from work just to play with my new toy. ;-)####$$##%POSITIVE
i really don't have favorites  but now i dont have to watch with subtitles so its easier for me :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Dynamic immersion just makes the most sense to me.  This woman I used to date has a masters and bachelors and took a lot of spanish for her journalism and English degrees, within about 2 months I was halfway through the Spanish packs and she said I was nearly at her level. HAHAHHAHA!####$$##%POSITIVE
Tech support needs a better system!  My last studio was marred by constant tech support interruptions - they kept muting me, and I kept taking it out of mute mode.  Others were pulled out, and then put back in.  I feel, unless there is really some serious issue, such as not being able to hear, leave everyone alone!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
This has been a problem for me as well.   When someone signs up for Studio, they are committing a real chunk of time. It should be rare to never that RS support staff mess it up.   It also seems that they ruin the session without asking permission and often without a good reason.   In my experience, they don't follow up by even explaining the reasons for their behavior.  I don't think they even have rules of conduct by which they work on these problems.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's probably my biggest issue with the incident I experienced: No one asked for my permission to take me out of the session, or even explained what was happening.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They've done that to me as well.  It would be nice if they sent an IM asking for permission!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Marcus is the best...I have had him as coach many times!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been told, after the studio, that I caused problems in the studio.  Really??####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow, last week during my session I kept noticing I was on mute a few times and I just kept un-muting it, now I know why!! the nerve!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had the same problem once.  Pulled into an alternate studio universe with no way to find out what happened.  I was so upset, I stopped doing studios for a while afraid that I was doing something wrong.  I never was able to get an explanation.   It's never happened again so I assumed they fixed a problem.   Looks like it's still happening with others.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm going to try it but I'm not sure about the games yet.  I like reading the books though.####$$##%POSITIVE
Lower your prices and maybe I could afford any of your products!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried the link and when it brings me to the page for the game/demo it just keeps refreshing over and over again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the great tips! Geoffrey Feldman, Janice Kennedy & Ben Howard!####$$##%POSITIVE
The link does not work for me.  The page constantly refreshes the page.####$$##%NEGATIVE
wow...####$$##%POSITIVE
not cheap, about $125, but it's worth it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Its cheaper than classes and tutors and takes a lot less time.  It is worth every dime.####$$##%POSITIVE
What Matt said, plus you can study any time you like and at your own pace.####$$##%POSITIVE
I played Swedish and German. Got a good score and had fun! Games are one of my favourite language learning methods. Thanks for the free demo!####$$##%POSITIVE
For those of you who are already owners of the product, it is not a new game.  It is Picari.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No Korean :/####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was going to buy a 3-course but if it doesn't work out and I'm not allowed to sell it afterwards I'm not prepared to effectively bin nearly £300.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still can't enter the activation codes...need to know how I should be doing this...####$$##%NEGATIVE
and still...####$$##%NEGATIVE
best comment ever####$$##%POSITIVE
oh wow, thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
They have Dansh:   http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-danish/level-1####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I totally agree with you Cheyenne! I'm only on level 1 French but I must say "J'aime Rosetta Stone!".####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Sarah. Now I can add learners. Before I tried but I saw online services fee ( 1month, 2months,ect...). So,I confused. Thanks a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to try Rosetta Stone so bad!!  But with times being as tight as they are I'm worried!  Is it really worth all that money?  Then I have to figure out which language!  I'm thinking Spanish because my sister just married a great guy from Puerto Rico and most of his family only speaks Spanish!  But I also love Serbian, Russian, and French!  Any suggestions or advice?  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
The email was no help. I already heard all of this from the rep I spoke with on the phone who was no help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Joe, it IS worth the money, and you have familia to speak Spanish with! Also, if Serbian and Russian are as hard for you as Polish was for me, you might feel confident a little more quickly if you start with Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Italian is quite difficult but I'm getting there.####$$##%POSITIVE
First I wanna say I LOVE  IT im learning Italian for my trip to Italy next Spring. I just wish you had some type of android ran edition(if you do im sorry and please point me in the right direction). But as far as everything else great job.####$$##%POSITIVE
THE BEST SOFT WARE EVER!!!:X####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thank you! Can't wait to get started already!####$$##%POSITIVE
I like it. But sort of used it. And my computer is broken...so I'm lackey my Spanish. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
V4 has the studios and online games - they really challenge you!####$$##%POSITIVE
That's AWESOME :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I like teaching method.It is the same way as a child learns language naturally####$$##%POSITIVE
I wish I could! I bought your Dutch program for our children. I relocated to Holland for a couple years and learned Dutch there in a school.####$$##%POSITIVE
We've been in the states for 10 years now. :) Thanks for letting me know!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool.  I really want to learn Russian one day.####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait!!! And thanks for the good wishes!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think Rosetta Stone is expensive at all. If you took a 3 credit course in college, it would cost more than RS and you might have 30 people in your class. Also you would not learn with a natural method and probably would have to take many classes before you could actually speak. If you studied with Berlitz or  one of the other know programs , it would be thousands of dollars. You get free studios and sometimes you are the only person in the class and have personal attention. Even if not, you can't be more than one of four. Another aspect that you might not know is that Rosetta Stone, if you buy it from there website,  can be exchanged for another language, no questions asked. 2 languages for the price of one. I wonder why it is so inexpensive????!!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well the first answer is that it's not expensive when compared to other learning methods (school, self study, etc.) and everything you get out of it.  The product contains a lot of information and works well.    Now to look at the price one mist always consider first the development costs of the project and work that goes into the 30+ languages they have.  Recording voices, programming, beta testing, etc  Next what you pay and the subscription covers servers and their upkeep, the studio coaches and the great level2 tech support.  I'm sure I missed a lot, just keep in mind that cheap does not equal high quality. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Having learned language in classrooms, solo with CD's and text book and with RS the final factor is how RS uses your time more effectively ... less time to learn the same vocabulary in my experience.   Finally, you will also see the production values for RS are excellent.  What is in a picture that goes with a phrase is just that ... nothing else.  In less well conceived courses it can be harder to figure out what they are expecting your to understand.   In RS, the people who play the parts also do it pretty consistently.  This took some planning and is also a help, part of putting you in a world where they speak the language you are learning.   This i score to the concept of "Dyanamic Immersion".####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't feel bad about lowering the setting as well.  For some reason the voice recognition never gives me credit for the word for thanks, tack.  I finally turned the setting down to the easiest and the frustration is gone.  I have no problems saying teaterföreställning, sjukhus (theatre show and hospital) yet I "can't" say thank you correctly!  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I have everything set up correctly and strangely I have fewer problems when I get to the speaking section which has longer sentences. The pronunciation gets tough because of having to pronounce the words syllable-per-syllable. I also practise speaking in front of my partner who is a native, to which he says that my pronunciation is fine and Persians will be able to understand me. Maybe I should lower the setting. I guess I'm quite a perfectionist when it comes to learning a foreign language. Thanks everyone! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I raised the precision difficulty all the way to the very most difficult.  It takes me a lot longer to complete sections than it otherwise would, but it has helped my pronunciation greatly.  You eventually adapt to the proper pronunciation and it is no longer problematic.####$$##%POSITIVE
Or I'll just go to Iran and see whether the locals can understand me with few difficulties. I've decided not to lower the setting though. But I don't think I will increase it either. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
In my personal experience, (Arabic) some pronunciation issues are really grammar ones.  I don't convert to Feminine forms consistently for example.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think that's the case with Farsi. Despite having extra consonants and vowels, I find it easier than Arabic. Do correct me if I'm wrong though.####$$##%POSITIVE
I always had problems with the RS speech recognition recognizing Spanish words with the letter "p".  Egipto was the worst :-)   One day my RS headset broke and I bought a new USB headset from Plantronics.  All of a sudden, my pronunciation scores went way up!   You might borrow  a friend's USB headset to see if it makes a difference.  Most PC gamers have great headsets.....####$$##%NEGATIVE
They did lower their prices.  When I first looked at RS in April,  the 5-level set was $250 more.  Do you really know what RS offers? There are lower priced options which may suit you better.  I have RS for two languages and consider it an investment in myself.  Good luck to you.####$$##%POSITIVE
All companies follow market demand for price.   The fact is that if you were to get a comparable ability in language from a college course it would cost you several times more.   Similarly, you can use RS and then skip to more advanced levels in a college program. Time is a huge factor in learning and RS definitely uses less of it and is more flexible than a class room.    Then there is the benefit of learning a new language.  You will have better job opportunities and the discipline of it is good for your mind.  So, not only is it less expensive but it will pay for itself in terms of your life and career.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree. I don't regret it either.####$$##%POSITIVE
Neither do I!####$$##%POSITIVE
Learn Arabic or Farsi, you'll be more valuable to the military & then the government when you retire.####$$##%POSITIVE
I never thought of Rosetta Stone as a dating site.  I just want to learn Czech because my ancestors came from there.  When I realize what the other countries are that my other ancestors are from, I'll want to learn those languages too####$$##%POSITIVE
I just may do that Arabic for myself and try to get my boys into Spanish. Thank you everyone :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi there!  I started on RS with Arabic.  Long ago, 40 years ago I learned French in HS and College classrooms.  It was rusty but as I learned Arabic, I found French popping in my head.  So, I also got the French course.  Because of past experience, I went through that very fast but it was a nice tune up.####$$##%POSITIVE
Called out!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for saying this, though there will always be those who will complain.  I took 24 credits at university in German before I found out about RS, and spent MUCH more than RS and really learned a lot less.  With RS, I have been, finally, able to communicate in German and fell much more confident.  I still have a ways to go, but I see it as a positive investment  in myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
On RS website, they have where you can pay in i think its 5 payments instead of one now.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a great value in the eyes of many people, and cost-prohibitive to others.  The same is true for other high quality products, such as Mercedes cars or Harley motorcycles.  You have to either save up and splurge or just forget about it.  If you need to learn a foreign language for your career or just really live the idea, you should just shell out the money.  It blows away other language learning options.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Spanish (Latin America) right now - I'm on level 4 - right off the bat, EVERYONE who hears me speak now, tells me my accent is very good.  Most are even surprised at how good my accent is.  Recently Rosetta Stone did a Spanish-only Webinar; I understood about 95% of the Spanish that was spoken and it was just a normal conversation! I was thrilled to be able to understand it as they were just talking away about how Rosetta Stone works and answering questions!  Now, as to how quickly you'll learn, don't expect to be fluent in 6 months or even a year.  This takes time and effort.  The amount of time you put into it is up to you.  Everyone learns differently so what may have taken me 3 weeks to understand, could take you 1 week.  It all just depends.  Get it, use it, and if you feel overwhelmed, that is perfectly okay; you can go back and redo lessons if you need to.  I hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
So Matt how long have you been studying?? I have a pretty good basic understanding of Spanish as I have been trying to keep up with some conversational stuff through our rec center and local programs. Plus I have a parent who is living in Ecuador.  But I need to learn French first cause I am switching careers to Flight Attendant and French is a must! Spanish would be next and possibly easier for me.  Its been a few years since I took it in high school but then again my marks were quite high as I really loved it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Can you really equate buying a Mercedes vs. a Toyota with RS vs. a cheaper option?  For many, buying new brakes in their car is cost prohibitive because they would rather spend it elsewhere.  Priorities. If you cannot afford RS because it would mean not putting food on the table, then you really have to determine why you are even looking at RS in the first place.  Instead of complaining, use free options (library, internet) and save up for RS if you really believe that it will help you. If you really want to do something positive for yourself, you will not complain and will just find a way. - no matter what it is.####$$##%POSITIVE
Have fun learning japanese! I have been using it for almost 5 months and I love it. Plus, I can hold conversations.####$$##%POSITIVE
Many thanks...this will mean so much to her####$$##%POSITIVE
I have had about 24 credits of German and found that the RS product is geared more towards speaking and understanding the language.  I have learned much more with RS (and gained more aural/oral skills) than with the multitude of college level courses.  You get access to all levels if you purchase the disks.  I have the disks, and once I finish all 5 levels, plan to go back and start from level 2 again (introducing past and future tenses) to solidify the language skills.  I can actually go shopping in my town and speak German (bakeries, restaurants), and now I have more confidence to actually speak the language with natives.  You can check out the transcripts of the levels and see which level is best for you.    http://support.rosettastone.com/ics/support/DLList.asp?folderID=782####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Rosetta Stone I appreciate the help.####$$##%POSITIVE
Or Merci Rosetta Stone J'apprécie l'aide.####$$##%POSITIVE
Exactly... I'd like that too.  I'd also like a report that tells me which one is next so I can do it early if I want.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh thank you! definitely will do so :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Bonjour Dennis! Thank you! Once you start using Rosetta Stone it is hard to stop yourself! I have a few reasons as to why I wanted to learn French. One of the reasons is that I was born into a very french family. As you may or may not have gathered from my french last name. Going down the generations the language was not used in the home so I didn't learn it from birth. I however had a French teacher in Elementary school and always loved it. It was recommended to me when I moved onto Middle School and High School to start taking Spanish. I caught on to Spanish fairly well, but preferred the French language. So what I had learned in Elementary School was forgotten. I am a huge foreign film movie lover and my favorite Foreign films are all in french. One of my goals is to be able to start watching the films with French subtitles and then hopefully move on to not using them at all. It would really make me happy to be able to understand clearly what is being said without the English subtitles. It is such a beautiful language and when you use English subtitles you unfortunately lose a lot of what the characters say. Another one of my reasons being is that I am going to school to become an Elementary school teacher. I really hope to be able to bring some of what I learned into the classroom. When I have a family of my own I would love to be able to teach them French! I think it is really a great thing to be able to become bilingual! Plus, learning a new language is great for your brain! So there are many reasons as to why I wanted to learn! I don't know if I am quite ready for a studio session just yet! I want to, but I think I need to practice a bit more. The games are also a great way to practice! I am looking forward to my next lesson! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm also learning French, enjoy the games too, so far Memo is my fave. Bonne Chance!####$$##%POSITIVE
Merci Anne Marie!####$$##%POSITIVE
Solved !####$$##%POSITIVE
Dennis: I worry that I won't  be ready for the studio yet and will end up freezing! How did you know you were ready for studio? Either way I signed up for Tuesday! Wish me luck! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
trust me, rosetta stone is worth it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Tracie! I have been playing the games to help me out! They are really fun, but I've been feeling like most of the people I've been playing with are way better than me and get somewhat frustrated? Maybe I'm just being paranoid and self-conscious. Either way I'm going to keep playing the games and practice! Will do! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Robin - in terms of cost content the products are pretty much the same.  It's just how you want the lessons delivered, as Rosetta Stone described.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sorry I couldn't make it.  I actually missed a session tonight.  I thought I was scheduled for 9:30, turns out it was 7:30 - oops!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well.. this is what happened: my teacher went to Europe, for some reason, and the whole class had to use Rosetta Stone to learn it. Us being kids, didnt really care so we goofed off and played around####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had already tried that without success but went back in and tried again and it worked. Thanks for your help.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh french love that language <3####$$##%POSITIVE
My partner is Persian. Other than that, I always enjoy learning a foreign language.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's exactly it. Feel it, don't think it. Congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
A man, a plan, a canal- Panama!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok. Thank you. *L.M.T., M.M.P.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
To that, I would also add that you should expect to spend 4-5 hours a week to make good progress.  If, after completing that work you get a chance to immerse yourself in the language, that's great.  If not, then you should expect to be using the review process in the software for awhile to assure "it is really in there".####$$##%POSITIVE
Every once in a while, I am in a studio and just can't say ANYTHING! Then a few days later I have another studio and feel very satisfied afterwards.  I think that things go in cycles - before you know it you will be further ahead than you could ever imagine!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. I've also found that those periods pass and that then I've actually learned more.  I think that sense of "going backwards" comes in part from assimilating new words that at first may seem confusing with older ones.   You are not forgetting, you are experiencing confusion from finding more puzzle pieces.  That's my way of seeing it anyway.   I've learned to push harder through frustrating times.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. When I had my first japanese studio session I was confused! I did not understand what my coach said sometimes. After the 2nd studio session, I understand the whole thing.####$$##%POSITIVE
I feel the same way.####$$##%POSITIVE
I found out the max is 2 sessions scheduled at a time but they have to be different units. Trust me, I still wish I could schedule more than that. A daily session would be nice. :) Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
I knew this group of learners would have some insight into how I was feeling.  Thanks everyone for taking the time to tell me a little about your experiences.  It makes me feel better, knowing it's not just me.  It does make me want to push through, work harder as Geoffrey does, and I'm definitely reviewing too.  I'm on the unit 4 of Irish level 1 - not too far off from getting level 2!####$$##%POSITIVE
So far, so fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had that happen with my 1st session just a few days ago, so i went back reviewed all the core lessons from unit 1 in Arabic and did another session tonight and understood most of what was being asked and even learned new words.  sometimes I think my brain is working at all during the session and as soon as its over, everything comes rushing back into my head####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the replies. Still waiting for them to re-activate. It's the only thing I dislike about this software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Japanese . :) and u ?####$$##%POSITIVE
I think the most important thing in language learning is doing it regularly.  I think it is better to do less more often than to a huge push infrequently.   You want to keep your words sort of buzzing around your head.   I call this "Maintaining an even strain".####$$##%POSITIVE
I need some tips. First time at game night tonight and not thrilled. In the games where I had to type/describe things, I apparently could not use my backspace bar to correct my horrible typing. Every time I used it (out of habit), it closed out my game and made it look like I bailed out on someone that I agreed to play with. Is it true I can't use my backspace bar or am I missing something obvious? Help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Even when I get in to the extra help to say the phrase, it cuts me off after the first word. It will not let me hear a recording, so I don´t even know what I am doing wrong. Seriously, this is beyond annoying.####$$##%NEGATIVE
other languages work!####$$##%POSITIVE
I know just what you mean and I feel like throwing a shoe at it when this happens!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't know what happened but after couple of hours now it's working. Thanks tho####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Robin, it is the software. @ Geoffrey, I am in a quiet place, and I do keep my voice consistent with the program. It apparently just really doesn't like the way I say "disculpe" and won't even let me hear myself say it! Other things it takes first try just fine.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't use the headset unless I have to. I don't like having it on my head or around my neck at all. I just haven't had a problem like this until I got to having that word at the beginning of the sentence over and over.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Or...buy directly from Rosetta Stone. This makes me question Barnes & Noble, not RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Barnes & Noble say they bought from RS...  guess it####$$##%NEGATIVE
is a "he said, she said" situation####$$##%NEGATIVE
Can you return it to B&N?  I think that they give a 30-day return policy versus RS's 6- month return policy.####$$##%POSITIVE
Buy from RS next time.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have used two Rosetta Stone products and they are OUTSTANDING! I think this kind of complaint absolutely stinks. "I bought a car that looked like a Mercedes but turned out to be a cheap imitation therefore Mercedes Stinks?" Really?  If you have a legitimate bill of sale from B&N you have a legitimate legal issue with them.  It might be that someone is substituting fakes for their real stock or removing the activation cards from their stock.     Another possibility is that it was not purchased from B&N but from an online counterfeiter.   RS is not responsible for servicing fake copies of their product.  You did business with someone else, not them.####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Geoffrey, I always use the headset in sessions. I am well aware of the audio issues when other people don't, so I am willing to deal with it for that.   @ Sabrina, I do feel like I have to yell for this thing to hear me, sometimes even when wearing the headset. Which is funny, because if I put the audio out through the headphones, I feel like the program is yelling at me. By the time I turn down the volume to a comfortable level, it's one click away from being muted, even with the program's volume turned down in the preferences like RS told me to do.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hope to get to the bottom of it... thanks everyone for the info.####$$##%POSITIVE
Russian and Swahili. Awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
Contact their support.  I had a similar problem with a hard drive and they helped me install on my new machine without any problems.####$$##%POSITIVE
Dutch musical of Mamma Mia!####$$##%POSITIVE
How long did it take you to complete Level 1? How much time did you learn a day?####$$##%POSITIVE
I started in mid  July and I was doing two lessons in the morning and two at night####$$##%POSITIVE
That's helpful to know, thank you :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Learned the Swedish National Anthem today and finished Swedish Level 2 Unit 3 Lesson 1.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is my point.Since it is downloadable, why can I not buy it here? You should advertise that you sell French, but do not buy if you plan to  move to Europe as you will not be able to upgrade it there. Pointless.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks I look forward to that.####$$##%POSITIVE
You are very fast learner James!####$$##%POSITIVE
Luckily Swedish has no SV agreement...so I knew I was safe there...but I was way worried about my formation of plurals...which he pointed out...were wrong..but who cares...he understood me and he was amazed that someone from the USA would take the time to learn Swedish!  Way to go, Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats, James!  I think that most people in northern European countries speak English, so anyone (especially Americans) who learn or make an effort to learn their language is pleasing and amazing to them!  German is going ok.  I start back for the rest of my business German program in a week.  After RS, I feel that I understand more and am more comfortable.  I am in Level 5!  I have Italian, too, and will be going for that by the end of the month.  I guess that your ankle is back in good form??####$$##%POSITIVE
That's awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
This really makes me want to try this####$$##%POSITIVE
I blame Rosetta Stone...it is simply too fun not to learn!  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your emotive story it helps me a lot####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that for anyone, the first time they communicate successfully in the target language, it is an exhilarating experience!  You go, James!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the activation code. That is great! I'm excited to get back to learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
I finished Portuguese but I go back and review items from Level  2 and 3.  For Spanish, I review items from Level 4 and 5.####$$##%POSITIVE
Best thing about Swedish...Verbs do not inflect for person or number in modern standard Swedish AND The only subjunctive form used in everyday speech is vore, the past subjunctive of vara ("to be"). It is used as one way of expressing the conditional ("would be", "were"), but is optional. Except for this form, subjunctive forms are considered archaic!!!!!!  WHOOO HOOOO!  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
In total there are 6 spoken active-voice forms for each verb: infinitive, imperative, present, preterite/past, supine, and past participle.   The grammar has to be the easiest, hands-down, of any language I know.####$$##%POSITIVE
NO subjunctive???  WOW!####$$##%POSITIVE
I finally figured it out. Sometimes I just get frustrated and need to put it aside and try again. I'm new at this and just learning to navigate the program.  Thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Stuart! I have to admit I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more Greek learners playing. I occassionally feel alone in the Greek learning world ;-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Aaron!!!! That is great news!! We just ordered the French & Spanish (Latin America) Level 1 & 2 sets :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I posted it with the German and Italian support group on the Discussion Page.  I think that it helps if all the support groups are in one place so that people can find them.  Anyone else up to start a support group???  It is great to network and learn more about the target language and culture(s).####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Matt, thanks for the recommendation, however, at this time (from what I've read on the Rosetta website), Levels 1 & 2 would be sufficient for us :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'll put in for what Matt said and also point out that if you buy direct from RS (not a book store) then you can return it any time within six months for a no questions asked refund.   So, if you only get two levels - in the likely event that you go through that faster than expected (most do) and want more - you have that option.  Likewise get five levels.  I really cannot imagine only stopping with 2 levels.   You get past and future tenses more in 3 levels by the way.  also they they have a 5 payment 0% interest payment plan which might soften the blow of buying 5 levels too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Appreciate the info Geoffrey....If we find that going to the 2nd level isn't enough, we can always go for the 5 level one. Yes, we did purchase directly from Rosetta...got free shipping too :D####$$##%POSITIVE
It may be "enough" for your needs but I think that once you get that far, you will not want to stop.####$$##%POSITIVE
Have fun learning japanese! I am learning it with RS. I can't wait for us to play in rosetta world!####$$##%POSITIVE
Muahahahaha. Si####$$##%POSITIVE
In The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) I placed solidly in B1 after completing Level 3 Spanish (Latin America).  You have a working knowledge of about 1500 words.####$$##%POSITIVE
B1-Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes & ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.####$$##%POSITIVE
Intermediate according to what measure?   Level 3 is more than levels 1 & 2 and less than 4 & 5 ... so that's pretty intermediate.   What do you want to be able to do when you are done learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been waiting for months for RS to put back diacritic sensitivity in writing activities in Portuguese. It used to be there in V3, and it disappeared in V4. I reported the issue, and was told that this should be fixed "soon". Still waiting and hoping.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am learning spanish, its amazing! But sometimes some of the words are a bit hard for me. Anyways thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
it does have a place to change it, but i just don't see the specific time zones. i'll just try it out and if the time is an hour early or later, i'll know. :) i'm already in US and Canada time on Rosetta Stone. its GMT time. but the hours in the US are ahead or behind by an hour or so depending on where you live. i appreciate your help! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
it takes me to my profile but just has one timezone for the two countries.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Do you realize that you can install on two computers and each computer can have five users?   However, for each user to use Rosetta World features, each must have their own subscription.  The subscriptions are great but you can get a lot from just the course and if you are all practicing the language together, you get a benefit there too.####$$##%POSITIVE
all i needed to know was that it was set in Eastern time. :) Danke!^^ now i can schedule a session!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh that's great! Thanks for the info. ####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Janice.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning words, here and there.  I had one semester of Japanese, and private lessons, but can't remember a lot.  There is a very active community in my town, and I would love to go to events! There is even a private school that teaches only in Japanese.  Maybe after German and Italian!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, oops. Must not have looked carefully enough.  Thank you Tracie.####$$##%POSITIVE
Since you are learning German, I started a German support group.  Free to join.  I just posted YOUTUBE videos for three pop songs in German, and for the site tatort which is a German TV program that does crime dramas (TATORT means "scene of the crime" in English).  The current offering is free through their website and is a 90 minute crime drama.  Also, I have posted links for German/Swiss/Austrian newspapers, travel info, etc.  It is NOT affiliated with Rosetta Stone, but most are studying German with RS, so we can work together for the online games.  You can post in English or German.  http://www.facebook.com/groups/234004253305594/####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you all so much for your help.####$$##%POSITIVE
Why don't you post what the issues are?  Then maybe some of us have encountered the same thing, perhaps found a way around them or at least can commiserate.####$$##%POSITIVE
Im having that same problem!####$$##%NEGATIVE
THANK YOU!  I will give it a try when I get home tonight. FYI, I specifically asked the online chat support if uninstalling and re-installing Adobe AIR might fix the problem and I was told "no, it would not".  Your tech support folks need to get on the same page . . . .####$$##%NEGATIVE
I believe you about losing fluency.  When I was a teenager, I was fluent in Italian(spent time in Venice and northern Italy). I got RS Italian, too.  German is my first priority, though. I got the discs because you get to keep the course forever.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been afraid to upgrade of AIR bc I had this problem a few months ago. when will tech support it with the most recent version?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ah, great! Thank you very much! As for the games, I haven't really done any of the online stuff yet. I should! I'll check Memgo out!####$$##%POSITIVE
Alex - I just responded to your email but un-installing and re-installing Adobe Air did not work.  I am getting the same error message, i.e. "The installation of this application is damaged . . ."   HEEEELLLLPPPP!!!  I want my RS working again!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Issue is still not resolved, despite the fact that I have done everything that tech support has told me to do.  5 days and counting since this issue occurred.  I need this resolved NOW!  BTW, I have been on hold with RS tech support, waiting for a live person to answer, for over 15 minutes now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It teaches it by experience, by using the correct phrases in certain situations.  It does not provide a grammar book or drill you on parts of speech, tense and so on.   The idea is to replicate the language learning experience of a child or someone who simply arrives in the languages country.   Later, you can purchase a grammar book separately and learn then with what is already an instinctive grasp of the language.   I personally think, based on my experience, that this is a more efficient (in terms of time) way to learn.   If you doubt this system, they will give you your money back within six months no questions asked if you buy it direct form RS (not a bookstore).####$$##%POSITIVE
If you really love what you are doing, you would definitely succeed. This means that it doesn't matter how hard may be a language to learn, as much as you try hard working on, you will get it ;) I'm 17 and I already speak 3 languages and a half with my intermediate French and Italian.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the feedback Jordan! I hope someone who knows for sure will be able to comment and let me know! :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
i used it for personal reasons. i have always wanted to be able to communicut with my german cousins and grandmother, who lives with us. if you're passionate about the language or about wanting to learn it, it is definately not a chore, but something thats really truly fun and exciting. on top of rosetta stone, however, i have also used workbooks, and i have found that the combination of rosetta stone for the repetition and straightforwardness and the books for grammatical definitions and explanations has been the best possible way for me to learn german. i hope this helped!####$$##%POSITIVE
Anyway we can have a contest where we can win this? I cant afford this product right now but would love to learn a foreign language!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've had a computer die with RS on it (v.3 Russian) and the support people were very helpful to help me set up my RS on my new second computer.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone for answering my post, but those answers didn't really get at what I was asking. Basically, I wanted to know if you have a computer die, or you end up getting a new computer after two times of doing so does that mean you have to buy Rosetta Stone all over again? For instance, if I were to  download it on this computer I have now, but it dies and I get a new computer. If then that computer gets old and I get a new one-since it is the third computer, does that mean I have to get a new Rosetta Stone set? Thank you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have recently completed the first lesson of Latin American Spanish and and 100% satisfied and more.  I love it!  My husband, 8 yo daughter and 12 yo son are using it also.  We are all very pleased.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just finished disk 1 of German. I love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks ladies!!!  We ordered Spanish Latin American. We haven't received it yet but I'm excited.  My daughter in law and her family is Latino.  When she and my son have children, they want to teach english and spanish at the same time as they grow.  I thought we would go ahead and learn it ourselves so we can carry that out when they are here.  I think they are going to start trying to start their family next spring so we have some good time to start learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for a fascinating explanation!!####$$##%POSITIVE
We have Spanish and our computer crashed so we got a new computer and tried to reinstall it and it refused to let us install it so basically we had it for a week and wasted a lot of money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
and yes, the product puts EQUAL stress on reading, writing, seaking, and listening. it is NOT only for speaking####$$##%POSITIVE
That is a WONDERFUL idea!  If you speak Spanish, then it'll be easier to keep it up and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment!  Also, your grandchildren will need to be bilingual with Spanish in the years to come.  Kudos!!####$$##%POSITIVE
German and might i say it is beutiful language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love my Rosetta Stone-Latin Spanish course. It's addictive. I haven't done any of the support stuff yet.####$$##%POSITIVE
if i had the money i'd buy all the Russian lessons. its REALLY expensive. :p####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome! I am so glad that this is the case! I can't wait to purchase my copy. I really loved how the site has the Demo! Very addicting! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Jillian - the support stuff. do you mean the studio sessions and the game-playing?  That, to me, is the best part of the program!  I LOVE speaking with native speakers and actually using the language!  You'll LOVE it!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried learning Korean using Rosetta Stone, but I found it to be very complicated.  The concept of tone was something I just don't hear well.  Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese all rely on tonal distinctions.  It's going to be a challenge to learn.####$$##%NEGATIVE
awsome! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm learning korean too, and have definitely noticed that too, how far are you?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you! Yes, Spanish, and I'm very much impressed by he quality of your product!####$$##%POSITIVE
I wanted to perfect my Bahasa Indonesia since I've been living there for many years and needed level 3 & 4 but you only have level 1 for begginners, too bad. Thanks anyway.####$$##%NEGATIVE
aww...ok thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
I can hardly wait to speak you in Italian!!  :0)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much rosetta stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Rosetta Stone, i can now learn German! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Great!!! I am having a wonderful time there talking about my experience and now....hearing YOUR QUESTIONS!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm in web session too, I can read spanish, understand spanish, but when I have to speak it, my brain does not comprehend. Is it my age? 47 yrs####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks, I'll remember that.####$$##%POSITIVE
All these updates are messing everything up!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had that 2 or 3 days ago and just closed my laptop down and re-started it up again and then everything was fine.  Not tried it to day yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
tried that....didnt work. thanks though####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Of course, non. I will schedule though. You convinced me... Like you said I'm scared to fail. I have time so maybe I can schedule 2 a day.####$$##%POSITIVE
Lisa you need to schedule!!!! Go ahead, don't be afraid. We are not perfect, but we can be better! Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa!!!! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't consider it a failure, but a learning experience.  I had the same problem in German, and RS studios have helped me immensely. If I have any "Angst" about the studio it is only about the tech issues or the other students.  I am in level 4 of German (unit 4), and look forward to going to the German bakery and German events in my town and speaking with native speakers.  By the way, I'm older than you are!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm in Level 4, Unit 3. I think at this level, it just gets a lot harder. I'm taking Spanish, LA. It's hard to wrap your mouth around saying the phrases, just like it would be difficult for an English learner to pronounce some English words and phrases. I'm 68 and I'm still learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Rosetta Stone :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm studying rosetta stone right now! it sure helps alot! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Borders (they're going out of business and placing everything on sale up to 60% off) has them listed, in store, for roughly $600.  That's after they "marked them down".  When I told the cashier that they were cheaper on the website by almost half, she just shrugged and told me to buy it from the website, lol.  Gotta love how people don't care when they're losing their job anyway.  XD####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'am a Rosetta Stone French proud student .!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! I am Also learning Greek!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that even for someone with some experience in a language just jumping in to 4 and 5 would be a little dicey as they build on the prior levels.  However, where RS has added levels, an upgrade kit would be very nice.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yep, it took 30 mins for mines to upgrade.####$$##%NEGATIVE
wow thats great to know. Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Once you check out on the website, down in the left-had side is the PAYPAL icon.  You can also just put your credit card in.####$$##%POSITIVE
im signing up for the payment plan####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, that's a really good deal.  How often do you get 0% interest? Good luck in your language studies!  I am on Level 4 of German, and Level 1 of Italian and really wish that I had known about Rosetta Stone before I started the German program at the local college.  It is so much easier, no grade pressure, and I have learned more w/RS than in the 8 classes of German that I took (I can actually speak now!)  I know that you will be successful!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's cheaper than most alternatives####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you. i just bought five levels of Italian. Im so excited.####$$##%POSITIVE
Did you know that there is a RS Italian SUpport group on FACEBOOK?  NOt a part of RS, but there is some interesting information.  Free to join.    http://www.facebook.com/groups/249076028437508/####$$##%POSITIVE
Chad I wish it had been too but I still got, I have tried cheaper and free alternatives but you het what you pay for. I'm loving using RS  it's fun and enjoyable and it's actually does work as I'm retaining what I learn and starting to think  multi lingually ####$$##%POSITIVE
yey thanks!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the approve too. Cant wait to learn italian with u guys.####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Alex thanks for the help, resetting the clock did the trick but I am taking the night off from it. this was not a pleasant experience.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you all for the feedback. The price looked suspicious that was my question (I'm new in purchasing on line) Thanks once again to all.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Geoffrey, that's a good point! I have not taken in consideration before. I will put that on mind in my next purchases :). Thank you once again.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have just started the Turkish 2 weeks ago and I am completely addicted to it now .... love it :)  I won't say its easy but like learning anything you have to put the time in :)####$$##%POSITIVE
gotta love the fact USMC gets Rosetta Stone for free####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! - I have never seen the "confirm" or "cancel" buttons on the email before.  Threw me for a loop there for a  moment!####$$##%POSITIVE
Already did.  :-)  Figured it couldn't hurt to ask here too.  :-P####$$##%POSITIVE
Great! But I can go 2:00pm-7:00pm. Because later I will be in class... Thaks for the information. Hope there I can meet more people and join more the Rosetta :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Christy.####$$##%POSITIVE
The sales people can be a real turn off.  I ended up buying on line and got most of the information that I needed before buying either on this website, or at the kiosk near me.  The sales people were gruff with me, and it is a real turn off.  IMHO, they need to be trained again and monitored.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Where are they at?####$$##%POSITIVE
I actually liked how laid back it was. Everyone involved seemed nervous at first but soon we were laughing and enjoying the session. I've already scheduled my next session and can't wait. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Tired, right?  Yes, I definitely noticed fatigue after Studio.  It must be that constant feeling of needing to be on top of your game...especially if you are the only one in Studio!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love being the only one in studio, too.  Makes me really work, and I feel that I have actually accomplished something.####$$##%POSITIVE
Same with me ! And support team have not solved my problem yet. Losting two days :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got the error after tech support closed for the night - was hoping someone here had the same problem and got it resolved...I'm calling once they open to see how they can help :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Christy - I managed to get it solved! Rafael - just go to http://www.rosettastone.com/v4upgrade and download the update from there - worked for me :D And I didn't lose my progress! YAY!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Michelle and Stephanie.  This is more than change, this is finally getting to speak my mother's native language -French!  This is a very exciting journey!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice job scheduling two Studios on one day.  I have tried it but I found out, for me, one a day works better.####$$##%POSITIVE
I started practicing my French, them haven't Had ako work on my laptop for 5 months so haven't Done it since####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well , i am lerning german cuz  i am studying it at school  and  i would like to improve it so i use rosetta stone####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone is a very good tool to learn a new language i find it extremely easy and funny to learn a new language with rosetta stone####$$##%POSITIVE
Danke Rosetta stone !####$$##%POSITIVE
Ich auch ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Dankeschön####$$##%POSITIVE
Oui!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it can be overwhelming at first but it really helps to review learned material....did you recall after 6 wks? ####$$##%POSITIVE
I sure will.  It really is a great way to learn!  I haven't scheduled any online sessions yet but will doing that very soon!  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Not quite.  Notice the accent mark on the one for "baby".  But like Rosetta Stone said, you'll notice a pattern soon.####$$##%POSITIVE
Just ordered the Chinese :)####$$##%POSITIVE
i am still waiting on my sample disc...i have written for it called for it and sent requests here and on the site and still have not received it, i am about to go to another company  at least i can get what i ask for in a reasonable amount of time, i am about to write a not so  nice blog post about rosetta stone and the customer service i am receiving####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have the sam problem! How can I fix it?####$$##%NEGATIVE
woot woot!!! I'll take the Russian 4 and 5 please.####$$##%POSITIVE
ooooooohhhh, that looks really cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been requesting Hindi!  And gotten as many friends as I can to request it too. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I've just sent in my request for levels 4-5 for Japanese.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm looking forward to making some connections so I'll have other learners to play the games with in the future. I was totally kidding! You know I didn't really think you'd forgotten about us.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ma'am I've tried reaching your Technical Support by chat and phone but after all the waiting I can't get in touch. Is there anyway you could just tell me what to do about this error 2124 so I can get bath on track? I would greatly appreciate any instructions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the link!  It is really unbelievable after finishing that one session how much of it I understand.  It is quite an amazing learning tool!  I feel that for some strange reason, the latin alphabet may hinder the learning process, while strange characters become easier to learn as you associate meaning to them.####$$##%POSITIVE
Levels 4 & 5 for Portuguese!!! Yeah!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be nice but as she said there are no plans to do so. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
pretty good.......I got to work on being consistent in my studys' though!!####$$##%POSITIVE
But only one have acces to the virtual class and the games? Because I have one now and only me can go into those things!####$$##%NEGATIVE
WOW!!! Thak you!####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a fine line we walk when in Studio. One to four word answers seem to be the norm in Level 1.  It can be a bit off putting when every answer is long and drawn out with words that are obviously not from that Unit or Level.  Being on the slow end with Swedish, I have a LOT more patience with fellow students in Spanish (Latin America) Studios, especially when reviewing Levels 2 and 3.  I guess you learn more than just languages in Studio...which is definitely an added bonus!####$$##%POSITIVE
Interesting discussion on Studio etiquette.   I frequently do Studio reviews of previous units and like Taylor I try to gauge my level of participation to that of fellow students.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't mind if there is a slower student, it helps me learn, too.  Also, I think if you are taking a lower level studio, you may not remember what words NOT to say.  I guess there might be some obvious show-offs, but heck, maybe you can glean some new words from them, too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Finally Russian is out in 4 and 5! ####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait until I can get it myself.  There's a lot of languages I want to learn.  But I'll start with one and if I like it I'll get others.####$$##%POSITIVE
Russian is one of the languages I want to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks ! That solves it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Jennifer is learning Japanese!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
The payment plan makes me want to try it.  I just need to decide which language to do first.####$$##%POSITIVE
I hate roseta stone..........####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do realize they are a pretty good deal.  When I took Japanese I paid 200 a semester and you were expected to take it for four years. I should start with Mandarin since I plan on going to China.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Angel - I think that the 5-level languages are an excellent deal.  I am starting level 5 of German, and even after 8 German classes, at university, I have learned more and it is much more personalized.  Go for it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I attended this webinar. It was awesome.####$$##%POSITIVE
In fact, this is my recommendation ... if you experience a bit too much frustration, don't be afraid to back up and repeat past material.  RS makes this easy.   Imagine a class room where you can say to the teacher: "Remember 3 weeks ago last Wednesday?  Do it again, right now."####$$##%POSITIVE
Sounds awesome! I had this idea in my head that it was going be like with a native speaker who is trying to learn English and had similar words and phrases to mine. Thanks for clearing that up!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah that would be fine####$$##%POSITIVE
yeah that is fine####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your help. Can't wait to order them. :-D####$$##%POSITIVE

My 5 year old loves my rosetta stone italian!####$$##%POSITIVE
I LOVE Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ah, awesome! Thank you! I'm learning Swedish, hoping to move on to Korean when I'm done!####$$##%POSITIVE
Colloquial Norwegian (Book/CD) and/or Pimsleur are good starting points. Rosetta Stone is awesome but Norwegian isn't part of their repertoire (yet!). However, learning Swedish will get you a lot of valuable knowledge that you can use in Norwegian too, the two languages are quite similar, mostly mutually intelligible. RS has Swedish and it's a great course. Good luck! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks to both. I will look into that. and Yes I have put in a request, just waiting on it to appear####$$##%POSITIVE
 i think it's very good idea. such group will improve our german langauge. please when u do it join me to this group####$$##%POSITIVE
@Kory Byrd: I'm learning German :-) Just started.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had 8 college courses in German and started with the first level.  EVen though it was a review, it still helped solidify the basic information and helped fill any gaps that may have been there.  Also, since you say that speaking is difficult, the studios will really help out a lot.  I have had to speak in college classes, but the studios are intimate settings in which you can really work on your vocabulary, pronunciation, etc.  Not a lot of difference between Spain and Latin America.  The accent and the vocabulary can be a little different, but you can be understood by native speakers no matter which one you choose.####$$##%POSITIVE
I started out with Level 1 Spanish (Latin America) even though I lived in Buenos Aires.  It is a huge confidence builder if you have a background in the language you are learning.  I always picked up something from each Level.  Levels 4 and 5 were where I was really being stretched to learn new things, especially vocabulary.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks ####$$##%POSITIVE
Of course, there were some words and phrases I didn't understand, but I could understand enough to get through it and even learned tons of new words in the process.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love that.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, it turns out that I FINALLY spoke to a live person last night and we did get my issue resolved.  It took about an hour, but Charles stuck with it until he had me back up and running.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks I've decided on French, then when I'm done with that one I will get Russian, then Dutch. :) Thank you so much.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm about to have my first session. Fingers crossed for a glitch-free one after the stories I've read!####$$##%POSITIVE
Sarah: I learned quite a few new words; thanks Marcus and Sandra for going beyond the words in the Unit in question. I just forget this moment what they all were; but I'm sure they'll come back next time I need them!####$$##%POSITIVE
I first raised this issue about 5 days ago.####$$##%NEGATIVE
15 minutes on hold and still waiting for a live person.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Tech support answered and turned me over to L2 tech support.  On hold again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm a repeater.  I find repeating the studios helps to learn the vocabulary better than any other method.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thats exactly what I planned on doing too!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you Sarah!  i'm very excited & looking forward to starting as soon as it arrives today!####$$##%POSITIVE
last week one of my friends told me I should work for RS since I keep telling everybody to try it and buy it!! but what should I do?? Such a good software should be always on use!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Geoffrey is right.####$$##%POSITIVE
Alex - I am still trying to get support for my issue.  I have responded to your email and tried to talk to a real person.  5 days I have been without RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
And I am on hold for the 2nd time tonight - 15 minutes the first time and then put on hold again####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am not taking Korean, but I am in level 4 of one language and level 1 of another language.  There is grammar.  In fact, I have had both languages (German and Italian) at universities, and I understand the grammar better now (through RS) than I did before.  Maybe it is because it is not a grammar drill, but used in context.####$$##%POSITIVE
Just a hint, a less painful system is to leave a note on the support site.  It has the added benefit of keeping track of what you reported and what resolution you got.  This is what I prefer for myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yayyyy finally someone else learning Swedish! I'm starting proper Swedish classes next month but thanks to RS I don't have to start in the entry class =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yay! RS has been really helpful with tenses and plurality for me. Awesome to know someone else has an interest in this sing song language! Happy communicating!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm trying to use RS German in school for a grade but the school thinks that I should just take a virtual course with a teacher. From reading all of the feedback on here, I would much rather use Rosetta Stone because I've witnessed myself students who come out of a classroom with a teacher with very basic knowledge of a language and I would rather have a more wholesome learning experience at my own pace, and as a fast learner, I figure this is it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am in the fifth level of German with RS.  I took 8 college classes, and I agree with you, I had a basic knowledge of the language, and had a had time putting two words together.  At the end of last semester, I got RS, and have been diligently working through it all summer.  I go back to my German program in a week, and feel that I have improved 2000%! I can form sentences, make jokes, ask questions, and last night I actually wrote a two-page letter to another professional in German - without a dictionary!  There are 4 units per level, for a total of 20 units, and each unit has 4 core lessons with mini lessons after the core lessons that focus on vocabulary, pronounciation, grammar, speaking, writing, total review, and more.  There is speech recognition, so words that were never corrected in the class, are now being corrected.  Each lessons (core and focus) is graded.  If you get less than an 80% (I think?), it prompts you to do the lesson over, and you can do any lesson over if you feel you need to do it.  YOu may have to take a test for your school to prove that you actually speak German.  I suggest that you get penpals in Germany (Austria, Switzerland, etc), go to a meetup.com German group if there is one in your area, SKYPE people, and anything else to supplement your learning.  If you get the personal set, DO THE STUDIOS!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow! Thank you! :) This gives me so much hope. Now I'm super excited to pitch this to the school board. I appreciate your response to no end.####$$##%POSITIVE
Beautiful!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow, it's amazing.####$$##%POSITIVE
Amazing!!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been to Masada. It is a truly amazing place.####$$##%POSITIVE
+1 to everything Janice said. If by grammar your friend means "rules you won't remember" then yes, RS is lacking in that, but if you mean "patterns that become second nature" then no, RS has that in spades :-)####$$##%NEGATIVE
how beautiful king Harod.... so very long ago yet brand new to my eyes thank you for the glimpse please post more photos!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
спокойной ночи####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow I bet it was breath taking once upon a time :) So beautiful.####$$##%POSITIVE
You can look at the three-page intro or buy the 32-page exam guide for $10.  The test is $77, and it may be a good way to entice your school to let you use RS.  In any case, it may just be a good way for you to get college credits.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Dara: Funny... My mother is also Korean but her family live in South Korea. I would love to learn Korean so I can have a phone chat that doesn't end up in everyone being confused about what the other is saying ^^;####$$##%POSITIVE
Breathtaking!####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be AWESOME!  I have one language (Irish) installed on my computer and recently acquired a 2nd language (Spanish) that I would like to install on same computer...do I go thru the entire set of CD's with the Application CD and all language CD's?  Or go to Preferences, Add Language?  By having 2 languages on one account, how will my Home Screen be affected?  And my 3 month m'ship to Rosetta World with each language?####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow...What a great shot!! Thanks for sharing.####$$##%POSITIVE
Israel is beautiful!! Go Israel :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone gives grammar - word order,verb tenses, articles and the rest.  For instance, in English I say "I am tired because I went to the store after work."  In German, the word order is "I am tired because I after work to the store went." went is two words.  This is introduced, and pounded into you so that you "get" it.  I like that there aren't any drills, though I admit that I look up grammar points for understanding.  I have grammar books in English and in German. Since I am in a German program in a local college, I need to really understand it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just install the language CD's for the second language.   I recommend Defragmenting (as described in your Operating system help) before and after the installation too.   BTW, if you had asked the question first, I would have answered it.  Many of us have two languages and could have explained it for you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks you guys... Sorry for being a hightschool student that had too much summer vacation time and didin't know what syntax was...####$$##%POSITIVE
Sarah, thank you so very much!!!  This is exactly the support I needed and I appreciate you taking the time to walk me thru the process!  And thank you, Geoffrey, for taking the time to comment on my post...I need all the help I can get when it comes to technology!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't worry about it - you were clear as to what you needed and that is all that matters!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for that answer. I appreciate your comments.####$$##%POSITIVE
The price for Spanish is the same as for other 5 level courses.  If you  are serious about learning a language and price other alternatives as well as look as how much TIME it takes to use them, you will see that it is not expensive.  If you spend less, put in some time and give up, even if the price was less - the result was useless.  Is that less expensive?  A college course with the equivalent conversational proficiency would be multiple semesters and each of those similar to the price of the entire RS course.  If you miss class or flunk in those college courses - its your problem.  In RS, just try again.####$$##%POSITIVE
ok thanx####$$##%POSITIVE
SERIOUSLY disappointed you all will NOT put the Military on "TOTALe"....just doesn't seem right!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im soooooooo hungray####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't do anything in RS untill the issue with my Adobe Air error is resolved.  No luck yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
There is non for today for Korean Studio :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why can't I upgrade to totalE from here in Italy?  My v3 just isn't enough..... Help####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just ordered Latin America 5 Pt last night. Can't wait to start:)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm sorry...I don't understand what this is?  I recently purchased the French Homeschool program but is TOTALe something completely different?  Are we permitted/able to participate in this?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had already scheduled a studion for that day. It went very well (at least for me) and I feel like I made a "Breakthrough" after being stuck, to my frustration despite my best efforts. The scheduling part of Rosetta is difficult and it would be nice if in the future you offered acdvanced notice of Studion Slams. I find I have to scheule my sessions seceral weeks ahead which is difficult bc I may not be at that level or do not feel I would like to repeat that session.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Studio sessions do introduce new material.####$$##%POSITIVE
The first session, they will intentionally show you things like clowns or a brush do they can teach you how to say "I don't know"####$$##%NEGATIVE
Kristina: Wow.  Five languages.  That's amazing. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
People should not think of Studio as some kind of a test or way to show off.  It's just part of the learning process and it is intended to extend what you learn beyond the course itself.   Take studios as you progress in the course ...that's why there is a new level of them with each unit.####$$##%POSITIVE
In each studio session I've taken the coach has introduced new words that weren't part of the course .   That's part of the fun of each session.####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish French Italian English and now Greek i teach the first two. i don't mind the new material i just felt last time like i was expected to know it but the first time it was obvious they did it to teach how to say i don't know. maybe the other student was repeating the studio session and had already heard them. but i love rosetta stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the advice! I'll get to it right now :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Joe, v2 is awesome,and frankly I wish it were available still for other languages. It coddles the learner less, so you have to be much more self-directed and motivated, but it teaches an enormous amount in 1 level. Much more than 1 level of v3. It's definitely worth the investment if you can look past the 15 year old interface.####$$##%POSITIVE
"By grammar I ment order of words" That is syntax. You'll learn both grammar and syntax with Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the website, I found some really nice French poetry titles####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love to learn French and Hebrew!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love to learn Chinese & Swedish!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Sean. Swedish is easy to learn with Rosetta stone. I started it in December of 2010 and could have a conversation by my trip to Sweden for the World Scout Jamboree in July####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for you quick reply. I have submitted a request for Ukrainian. I hope it's made available soon!####$$##%POSITIVE
Can't find the language I want to learn! Help!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Arabic. It was a struggle for the first few months, and now it's starting to really click.####$$##%POSITIVE
Not enough!####$$##%POSITIVE
You definitely get enough to converse and enough to ask native speakers what things mean and how to say them.  RS teaches you to speak correctly but does not bother with technical grammar.  Except for that, I'd say that five levels are similar in scope to 2-3 years of class room learning.  If you are in HS, it will help you accelerate through that course and reach more advanced levels.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS can help you can become "conversationally fluent" meaning you can hold conversations.  True fluency comes with living in the country where the language is spoken and having to use it EVERY day to do everything and communicate everything.  To truly speak the language without fear and with natives, you need to also get other exposure to the language - reading, writing, speaking with others who are fluent in the language, etc.  RS is a start and will give you the framework that you need .####$$##%POSITIVE
Thankyou so much Geoffrey and Janice! Thats all i want to be, conversationally fluent. Im not to worried about writing and grammer. I just want to be able to talk to some of my relatives who speak spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
So know that I've hearrd this is a pretty good product, I hope I can be speaking Spanish in a year or 2. Or less. I just need the conversational skills####$$##%POSITIVE
Brian - with a reasonable and regular effort, you will achieve that goal easily in two years but quite possibly sooner.  What I think is key is to set the time aside for those 250 hours.   I would say about 30-45 minutes per day and then more intensive work during the weekend to maintain that 5+ hours a week.  250 hours is an average but some people go faster and some slower.   Also, after the first 3 levels, you will be well on your way and already able to converse.   Having family in your language is a huge advantage for practice too.  I'm sure they will be willing helpers.   RS has transcripts of the phrases in the course.  By sending them these as you complete the levels - they will have a good idea of how far along you are and then can help you better.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys! All of you really helped me alot. So now I have just purchased myself a Rosetta Stone hoping I can use it soon. Thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank U for that Info.####$$##%POSITIVE
OK, there are no news on Finnish, any news on Norwegian?  Any at all?  I am abuot to buy my husband another program that is not Rosetta Stone, but willing to wait if a Norwegian comes out in the next months.  ANY news at all???####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh my yes! Kamilla! I have sent in a request for norwegian months ago, I am sure it take a good amount of time to create a program to teach someone a language though. I have a question for you though! What programs have you bought your husband? I am going to try to learn and I have a girlfriend out there. Going to be living there for 3 months starting september. Any advice? :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am so sorry that our friends, up here, didn't understand the instructions. I cannot finish the story. Ok, let's do it properly : ごめん、日本語を話すことはありませんしています אני מדברת טעברית  שלום !####$$##%NEGATIVE
It doesn't ask####$$##%NEGATIVE
It must be awful getting updates every time someone replies to your post.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Really??I want levels 4+5 already.####$$##%POSITIVE
I was extremely impressed with the length and jump in level of complexity in the first story in Unit 1 of level 4; you really see just how much you actually know already. Also, the stories are excellent for teaching interesting aspects of the culture. They also recently changed the picture for the story about the Shaolin Temple to the pagoda forest, which is now a UNESCO world heritage site.####$$##%POSITIVE
Tracie, you have no idea! Dave Hayter and I are trying to get through them as quickly as possible. We both finished the s3 quite a while ago, and have been doing nothing but using Chinese regularly at our favorite restaurants and staving off our RS cravings with http://www.slow-chinese.com ...it's great to have another 2 levels to dig into, and studio sessions with an expectation of an advanced level from the learners.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey, sorry it took me a little while to respond.  Had a lot of errands to do this morning.  Of course with the 12 hour time difference you probably wom't see it for another few hrs anyway as it's 1:30 AM in America right now.  Yes, i'm going through the course at lightspeed.  I saw some of the pre-beta testing lessons and have been excited ever since.  Started Level 4 Unit 4 today, should be into Level 5 by Sunday.  The material is helping me immensely with my work and day to day life here in Beijing.  It's great to be able to immediately implement what I'm learning into real life.  My new friends/colleagues out here are impressed with how quickly my vocab grows.  As Mr. Jones pointed out we both finished the 3 Level Course awhile ago so I was speaking Mandarin pretty well before I got here.  So yeah, good stuff.####$$##%POSITIVE
One of the things I love about Russian is how a lot of times the word sounds like what it represents, my favorite is хихикать- to giggle (hihikat- more or less)####$$##%POSITIVE
BTW, in Hebrew, "tzartzar" is cricket, not mosquito (that's a bit confusing)####$$##%NEGATIVE
enlightened :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Laura glad you had fun, which language are studying####$$##%POSITIVE
Irish. It's tough but I love languages and learning. I have studied Spanish in the past and may have to get back into it as well!!!  The Studio is such a great concept!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Laura, I'm also studying Irish - maybe we can play a duo game some evening.  Who was your coach?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!  That would be fantastic! If you guys were to sell the music used for that commercial and the sound used in Rosetta Course when you get the answer right, I would be so happy! : )####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been studying Japanese on Rosetta Stone, and I don't think I could have done it without it! I do plan to enter that contest as well :D####$$##%POSITIVE
That's awesome!!!  Thanks for the inspiration!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I really wish missionaries got discounts because I'm going to need at least two more languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think so but RS is often available in libraries. They have a bulk order for their online product for schools which makes it possible for a school or library to offer it at very low cost to students.####$$##%POSITIVE
Would love to, but dont have the $100+ to get it :(####$$##%POSITIVE
Magnificent.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would definetly buy the Latin Spanish if I knew for sure I would be fluent but I've been told the contrary. Too expensive for the risk of not being sure. If anyone has learned please let me know:  )####$$##%NEGATIVE
The course is really not expensive. Spanish has 5 levels. I don't think any course can guarantee fluency. It takes years to be fluent in a language with a lot of hard work and time put in if you do not live in the country. You will definitely be able to communicate in Spanish at the end of the course. These are really wonderful courses!####$$##%POSITIVE
Loving it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Brad, if I may, I have been learning Spanish since June of '09 witht this program and I can tell you, I spent the $700 on version 3 and LOVED it! Before that I failed my Spanish class.  Now I have Version 4 and LOVE it even more. I can understand and actually speak much more Spanish then when I took classes. And Version 4 offers native tutors/coaches for you to practice with.  I'd encourage you to buy Rosetta Stone from rosettastone.com, rest assured that you have a 6-month 'No questions asked' money-back guarantee, and learn. Rosetta Stone really works and works very well.  I hope that helps! Oh, and to prove it works, I'll even type more or less the same thing I just said in Español without any translation for you if you'd like me to (though I'll need to copy and paste the letters with accents; ie. ñ, ó ect...)  : )####$$##%POSITIVE
LOVE IT. LOVE IT. LOVE IT. I agree on all of the comments the learners said on the video. I hope one day I will have a japanese conversation with native japanese person outside of the internet.####$$##%POSITIVE
LOL im leaning japanese too! love the miku pic btw :3 i just tried one level and was like "kabadayeesomethingsomethin what was that again?" *clicks repeat button* XD####$$##%NEGATIVE
*searches for RosettaStory app*  Ya know. It's been years. After all this time, with respect, I'm really starting to think that Rosetta doesn't give one flying !@#$ about Android users. We only make up a whopping 38% of the entire Smart Phone user population, and 65% more abundant than iPhone users; seems as though we don't matter. =\####$$##%NEGATIVE
This ad is AMAZING. I've hoped for ads like this for YEARS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks all for the feed back! I want to purchase the Latin Spanish really bad but I'm hearing a lot of negatives about RS online and also cheaper alternatives.. your thoughts?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I made that purchase in January. I have studied Spanish, off and on, for several years.  RS is what helped me get past a certain point. I will be studying tonight. Due to my work schedule, I have not been able to study for a few nights. I am excited. This is an absolute joy in my life. No regrets for me!####$$##%POSITIVE
Brad, I purchased Levels 1 and 2 Spanish Latin America in mid June and have completed Level 1 and have been reviewing it a bit before I move on to Level 2.  I suppose there are cheaper alternatives, but I can tell you that I have enjoyed level one, it never feels like work and therefore I stick with it.  It's not boring.  There is no rote memorization.  The online games are really fun and I get a lot out of them.  I also use the audio cds heavily because I have a 45 minute commute to work daily - each way.  There is a 6 month guarantee, so I suppose you could purchase it no-risk on that basis.  I definetly think it is worth it and I'll be purchasing additional levels once I finish level 2.  Sometimes I check a grammer point on the internet as clarification, and sometimes I use some other freebie apps on my ipad to play games (and find that many things I need to know I already learned with RS, so it is reinforement).  I also try to read a few spanish news articles online every day.... and find that I DO get the general ideas of the article pretty well, even if I can't translate word for word.####$$##%POSITIVE
Such a great story!  Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for our freed and may God bless you####$$##%POSITIVE
i love that movie the first when the indian calls the navy support its really great lol ####$$##%POSITIVE
There were also code talkers from Alaska!!  Explain the "land bridge " theory to me---they speak the same dialect!!  Marvelous story and man!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I hope the younger generation carries on the language. It's precious and should not be lost. We've lost many languages. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Riche, I was hoping that there was another option but I guess I have no other choice.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hey the MacBook air and Mac Mini have a cool feature where you can use the disk drive of another computer in you network wirelessly it's all explained on the apple site####$$##%POSITIVE
Also when I'm trying to switch your webpage from UK to US it doesn't allow me. And I need to check prices of levels 1-3. Coud you at least tell me here how much would it cost in US dollars? (Spanish Spain)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wanted to see price differences. Cause in Rosetta Italian and German website version for three levels is 479 euros, where in UK you sell for 289 pounds, which is around 311 euros. so it's much cheaper to buy in UK :D I also wanted to know how much it sells in US, but the website page cannot be direct from UK to US somehow. Coud you tell me how much 3 levels package cost in USA?####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes!! haha I had that kind of dreams when I was learning english (time ago) now I´m learning german and italian and noup, I haven´t had that kind of dreams yet, but Im sure, when it happens it would be a signal that I´m improving lol, =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hahah yes! I've had many dreams in Russian. My girl's English is good but I use Russian to bridge the gap between us when it comes to English. она из Украины!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nope, I have not dreamed in japanese yet. Sometimes throughout the day, My mind was thinking in japanese. I had no idea why. Maybe I am close of having that dream in japanese. Iheard that if you had a dream in another language that means you are close being fluent in that language. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I have actually it's really net I think anyway####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I am speaking, or trying, to speak Italian in many dreams. I also often think of Italian grammar or words when I first wake up.####$$##%POSITIVE
Guess I have to wait to get to another computer.  It's not working on my work computer.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was looking at my photos from Poland and thinking about all the communicating that had actually been successful, including at least one good story.####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be great. The kids have a one to one iPad initiative this year, but textbooks purchases are pretty much frozen. I purchased the software with department funds and ESL money. Those will probaly be cut, also. I am interested (personally) about more info on tne new developments I've seen advertised on t.v. What does this entail?####$$##%POSITIVE
OK, thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Plz make Hungarian available! I need it####$$##%POSITIVE
oh ok thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
totally agree with your comment Peter, it would be a great idea and I bet RS would get alot more customers, I'm also learning Arabic but have to find an alternate way to learn the Iraqi Arabic as alot of what RS teach is not what the natives speak in everyday situations####$$##%NEGATIVE
oh, thankyou####$$##%POSITIVE
It's pretty killer. WAIT and get the new edition though. Geoffrey, have you seen the new version of Alif Baa? It's ridiculous. They've really expanded their approach to dialects.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you all very much lol####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been trying to work through your email service.  Unfortunately your previously reliable information and contacts seem to have slipped today and I have not received a rea; response.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would love that too.  I got Japanese but I would love to learn many other languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks to Ms. Collins!  After I was finally able to connect with your tech support my problem was quickly resolved.   I've had technical problems about three times in the years that I've owned RS products and every time I am impressed by the knowledge and efficiency of your support people.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Alex!  That seals the deal - I'm off to get my Mac!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I  would like to learn Chinese, to prepare  lmao####$$##%POSITIVE
The question was brought up on an A4cwsn thread earlier today. I viewed Rosetta Stone's video and I can't help but wonder what a great tool this could be for our kids.####$$##%POSITIVE
I sit on the Hellenic Academy Board in Orlando Fl, and we are always trying to find new and exciting ways to encourage language learning. I did not see the thread but I agree this could be a great tool, thank you for keeping us in the loop!####$$##%POSITIVE
This is amazing. Period. A4cwsn has been a must read on my page daily and to see a potential partnership about language learning made my heart happy! What a great thought Cynthia McClelland Gregory!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, okay. Thank you!(;####$$##%POSITIVE
There aren't any workbooks or manuals with the personal set.  You get the software, the audio companions, the headset.  There may be manuals with the homeschool product.  Also, you can download, free, the transcripts for the lessons from the RS website.####$$##%POSITIVE
Gotcha.  Great, thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, when you buy, it is better to buy through Rosetta Stone - they offer a 6-month return policy and a 5-payment plan.  They have a store on the eBay site.  Some of the used stuff on ebay may not work or may be fake.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks.  I was comparing the items with eBay listings, and do find a much better option via RS directly.  FB allowed me to see options, but they are better with RS.  I'll be ordering thru there.  Thanks for all the great info!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.  That is helpful info.  There have been times that he was otherwise non-verbal but would speak into the microphone for Rosetta Stone, so it's always interesting to try.  Obviously, RS is quite a motivator!####$$##%POSITIVE
There are no workbooks or manuals except a simple users guide for the software.   What you are describing on eBay doesn't sound like it has anything to do with RS.  As mentioned, if you buy the software direct from RS, you can return it within six months no questions asked.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your response.  I completely agree with you.  I am introducing words, letters and numbers to my 19 month old son.  Maybe Rosetta is an overkill for him, or do you have toddler learning material?  That would be great for him..####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks.  It seems what I saw was for homeschooling.  I plan to order right from RS.  I appreciate the comments!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh my word...this just made my day reading this!! I have a 5 year old son ith autism, who is just now becoming moderately verbal. We use an ABA based flashcard method on my droid, but will be buying him an Ipad this weekend. The idea that I could get Rosetta Stone for him as an appl, makes me do a happy dance. This child is learning words at a rate I didn't know was possible a year ago, so I am willing to throw anything I possibly can at him that will be an effective language tool! :) I would love to see a child version ;) hint hint####$$##%POSITIVE
I also downloaded and printed the curriculum via the website. It has been helpful for me!####$$##%POSITIVE
P.S. I too, am a part of the A4cwsn...I have an odd feeling you might see a lot of us on this page now!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Have fun and just relax, I was nervous too but  its a lot of fun####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Riche.####$$##%POSITIVE
Depending on your language choice, I like to sign up about one week out from when I anticipate finishing a particular Unit.  With Spanish (Latin America) I have no problem finding Studios at all levels at all times.  With Swedish I really have to plan one to two weeks out.  It helps me to repeat Studios as well.  One word of advice...don't wait until you think you know everything backwards and forwards.  Studio is a time to test your knowledge and work on what is difficult.  You can always take Studio at the same Unit again to boost your confidence and to practice.  Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you,  I will.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the advice...I'm working on Spanish and about the finish unit 1####$$##%POSITIVE
Maybe tech support can help you?  Is there enough free memory in the laptop?####$$##%POSITIVE
My suggestion is to run defragmenting procedure for whatever operating system you have.   There is a tendency for RS installations to fragment the disk. This leads to performance problems.  So defragment.  Having multiple languages is supported, I do it myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
Agreed - and then teach it correctly such as the use of Rosetta Stone! I failed my school class... Now I speal Spanish pretty well thanks to Rosetta Stone! : )####$$##%POSITIVE
I assume the problem is that most learners are in the US.  It suggests that I should play between 2am and 6am.   Studio sessions are all in the middle of the night too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for all your helpful information! I live in Taiwan. Which version would you recommend?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you all!####$$##%POSITIVE
Unfortunately, there wasn't a problem in the session.  The problem seemed to be that tech support kept interrupting.  IF there is a problem, then I don't mind, but even when the coach writes to them and tells them that everything is ok, and they keep muting, and pulling people out - why??####$$##%POSITIVE
On a positive note, I enjoyed the studio when I finally got back in.  We role-played, and I enjoy that - especially when the other students are interacting as well! Thank you , Frank R. and Werner!!####$$##%POSITIVE
The program works very well, and more importantly, it is fun.  I have it for German and Italian, and I have learned more German (and am able to use it) than I have learned in 8 classes of German at university.  It costs a lot, but I spent more on college classes that frustrated me more than anything.  Add in the transportation, the books, the time, and the grade pressure, and it is so much more than RS.  I love languages, and want to become conversationally fluent in other languages, and I am going to use RS instead of a college class because not only does RS have the course, they also have games that you can play with other learners and native speakers, and small classes with native speakers.  It is individualized to your learning patterns. Also, the course has functional focus sections on pronunciation, speaking, listening, vocabulary, grammar, etc.  It is a good investment in yourself!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much for the information!  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
German is great! I just had a studio session, and my German has improved to the point where I can make jokes! I just finished the first unit of the 5th level and have enjoyed most of it.  Some of it got me really bogged down in the details, but you have to in order to speak the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
http://www.facebook.com/groups/234004253305594/####$$##%POSITIVE
good####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too!  Wanting to learn it again... took it for 4 years in school many years ago.  Now I'm wanting to re-learn it for a business degree.  Going to get RS to get me started and place later for higher level courses.  How does anyone on here think it does for you academically?####$$##%POSITIVE
All the courses are the same except the language you actually learn.  So whatever you hear for one language, especially one which like Hebrew has a different character set, is the same for the others.  I've done Arabic and it was great.   You will learn the characters and their pronunciation very early in the course.   You didn't mention your interests but this is modern Hebrew and not classical though it is probably a good path to study of classical hebrew.####$$##%POSITIVE
Whenever you can speak and navigate through a language, it helps you academically because you know what you are doing and feel some familiarity.  I can't wait to go back to German class at the university because I have much more confidence in my ability than I did before.####$$##%POSITIVE
Shalom Rick- I am totally loving learning Hebrew with Rosetta stone. The characters are introduced really efficiently and pretty soon you'll be very proficient in reading and writing as well as speaking and listening. I'm a huge fan.####$$##%POSITIVE
Highly recommend it. I'm doing it and it is awesome. I knew nothing in the beginning, not even the alef-bet or any words, and now I am gaining a comprehension of the language "from the inside," building toward real fluency. I can pick up words and phrases here and there with instant comprehension when listening to online streaming radio from Israel, checking out written or spoken Hebrew online, or even reading or listening to biblical Hebrew, since the ancient and modern dialects are so similar. I highly recommend Rosetta Stone for this language!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you....uh rosetta stone (or rather unnamed person typing for rosetta stone)####$$##%POSITIVE
Fantastic!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone Japanese is very good! I love learning japanese with rosetta stone. The studio sessions and games are fun! I can have intermediate conversations with japanese natives now. I learn so much japanese for the past 5 months that I thought I was a doing this for year. Time flies by soo fast.####$$##%POSITIVE
Grazie Mille!####$$##%POSITIVE
Another thing to know ... in terms of the concepts you learn in whatever language and how you learn them.. all their courses are the same.  Languages that don't have the latin font such as Japanese obviously need features for that, for learning the sounds with the letters but all non-latin languages are also similar in that respect.  So, if you see happy people with all the languages - that is really the experience you will have with any of them.####$$##%POSITIVE
it all depends how much time you have to dedicate to it, if you read some of the posting in this page, it takes 40-50 hours to get through each level. I'm finishing Level 2 Italian, I started the first week of June, I try to do at least and hour each day, that includes new material, reviewing, old lessons and doing studio session with the coaches. I fell that I have learned a lot, I can communicate with the coaches, and I have an italian pen-pal that I correspond with. I still make some grammatical errors but it is part of the learning process, but in general I can understand what they say and they can understand me!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you both but one question. one complaint i kept hearing was that even if you complete japanese level 3 you will only be at an advanced beginner level. is there any truth to this? be honest please because i dont need to waste my money if i wont learn that much by the end####$$##%NEGATIVE
I also think you should be ready to give the learning process five hours a week, preferably more.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, your continued motivation is a factor.####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Drew join a Rosetta Stone webinar on August 9th at 8 PM. You can ask the Rosetta Stone team questions on that webinar Here is the link:http://resources.rosettastone.com/support/English/WebinarDetails.htm?id=w1311343528w4e2983a83123b####$$##%POSITIVE
It's fantastic. Super old interface, but otherwise great. Chat rooms in all different languages. The only thing I dislike, as an anglophone, is the ubiquity of English in the rest of the world...it'll crop up in chatrooms for other languages, invariably.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think you will be further than that.   Basically you will be far enough along to handle all the tasks of a trip to Japan such as dealing with directions, money, problems, asking about the word for a thing, getting a conversation going, reading signs ... a long list of things.  You will definitely have enough to learn as much more as you want.  It's hard to assign a level but I am very comfortable saying that it would take a lot more time and a lot more money than RS involves if you went another root OR if you went into the country cold, it would be a long time before you simply absorbed the language by being there.  Either way it's worth it.   Learning a language, even your first language is a life long task.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow...I didn't know about this. Thanks for the link William!####$$##%POSITIVE
3 levels you can go to the website and download..its awesome :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Kk.. I will..####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning japanese in Rosetta Stone. I love it. You will a lot of things...You can play games in Rosetta World with other japanese learners. Also, you can play games with native japanese speakers! Japanese studio sessions are fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Anime, manga, JPOP, etc. are a main reason why I'm learning Japanese on here too.  And I also like to go to Japan someday because of it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Me 2####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone you rock!!!! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Not a very interesting blog...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am also learning Italian and attended my first studio session last night.  Perquelino (?) was very patient and I was very comfortable with the experience.  I am looking forward to many sessions in the next 2 months.  I leave for Rome on Oct 21st - can't wait!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely look into RS, Jessbella! A lot of people are turned off by the price, but it is definitely worth every penny of it. You learn so rapidly and by immersion, so I believe (over time) it is the cheapest method of learning a language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Michelle, thanks for the info!  What do I need to do to join the support group.  Sounds like a good place for me to be!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Wil....I will definately look into RS!!!..heard so much about it and how effective it is...####$$##%POSITIVE
It's really amazing! Worth every penny and more####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for helping me out!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thx!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
It works as good as the effort you put into it. I've tried other options and RS is truly the best.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you I will!####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried the trial a year ago, and I still remember what I learned! I cannot wait to purchase next month.####$$##%POSITIVE
Omgosh thanks so much for this info!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah,I agree with you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think it works perfectly. I used it only for about 4 months, and 2 months later, I still remembered everything well enough to live with a German family for a week.####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Sierra  you will love Totale what language will you be doing####$$##%POSITIVE
Brandon, it works! And if you' re not satisfied with it, return it within the first 6 months! Try one of the online demos and just see if you like it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Riche, I'll be learning German. It's beautiful and I plan on traveling there sometime. The school I'm going to is small and conservative so they're having trouble deciding on letting me use it as a foreign language credit; I'll be disappointed if they don't, but it won't stop me from using RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you, that ´s what I was looking for =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh yeah, maybe I'll get it. But it's going awfully fast >.<####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think the basic answer to your question is "Yes" but obviously not as much as 5 levels.   On their web site they list exactly the concepts which you learn to speak about.   With all the courses, they do a very good job of getting you started.  In addition to "Getting around", and especially dealing with safety, sickness, the law, directions, greetings, and all those daily things they also teach how to ask what the word for something is.   So you definitely get enough with 3 or 5 levels to go further.   That is something I am doing in Arabic.   I'd also say that in 4-5 you get more emotional and more things that have to do with fun and extra activities.   Another thing ... if you buy direct from the Rosetta Stone site or one of their Kiosks you can return the product within six months no questions asked.   By that time you should have a very good idea of where it is all heading and how it is working out for you personally.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thank you very much geoffrey!! =) I will use this to help me consider what to get.####$$##%POSITIVE
Holly - another thing from my experience. I have 3 Level Arabic and 5 level french.   The 3 level course got me far enough that I was able (after finishing it) to get a college Arabic text book and proceed with that, covering the 5 level type of learning as well as more technical facts about the language.   Had I got that text book without first mastering RS ... it would have gathered dust on a shelf.   However, the text book is still more painful than getting more from the 5 level course.  My point is that the 5 level courses are worth it and better but the 3 level are sufficient to get you going.####$$##%POSITIVE
...this is spooky! i just added Rosetta Stone's to my FB & my hubby & I were talking about learning German together...####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes.   My recommendation is that you go to the support.rosettastone.com site and write down the problem you are having. This puts you in their queue and documents the problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
I believe that customer service is closed on Saturdays.  Customer Success is open 7 days a week - I think.####$$##%POSITIVE
Customer Care opens at 1PM Eastern on Sunday - closes at 10PM Eastern.  Customer Success (Concierge Services) is open 1-10 Eastern Saturday & Sunday and 9AM to 10PM M-F (Eastern Time again)     http://support.rosettastone.com/ics/support/contactUs.asp####$$##%POSITIVE
Too bad that they won't give us any "hints" as to what they will release next!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great idea!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Ashleigh, but I already did, quite a few times!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning the Mandarin and it is a slower process than I wanted just due to how complex it seems to me. But I am excited about learning it just the same####$$##%POSITIVE
I love rosetta stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
great info clip!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Would LOVE to learn German, even traveled to Germany, but Rosetta Stone is too expensive to purchase.####$$##%NEGATIVE
#Gotta Luv RosettsaStone <3####$$##%POSITIVE
if u dont have rosetta stone u got to get it its the best####$$##%POSITIVE
I need the rosetta stone mirco chip brain implant how long till you guys make it? ####$$##%POSITIVE
Love ya Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had that problem so I ended up getting on late.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So true and I am glad that she learned German with Rosetta Stone. I have been doing the same thing in trying to get close friends and a boyfriend to teach me, but they fail in it. I am planning on purchasing the full Rosetta Stone suite for German and hunkering down and teaching it to myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, cool.  Tell him "hi!"!####$$##%POSITIVE
Luckily I can read 3 of those ancient writings, Hieroglyphics, Hieratic and Coptic :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Did you upgrade your software recently? I was a little confused as to which software I had to download.  Got it, though.  Thanks for the reply.####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning with a software definitely helps more than a native just for the beginning stuff which is all Rosetta Stone does. But surrounding yourself with the culture and stuff will help you progress from there, and speaking with natives :) it's what i did and i've learned ALOT####$$##%POSITIVE
Right you are.  I hope we get it right eventually.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
That can happen if, for example, the coach is sick.  It happens with live people from time to time you know.   The coaches typically work from home.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's all about time, will and talent.   I think the record is something like 23.   There are many people who know 3 or 4 and by "Know", they are familiar with the culture and literature and fluent.   I know someone who knows Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish, French, English and Berber (she is from Morocco) and works as a simultaneous translator for the UN.   She can speak in one language even as she hears in the other.  She is the most proficient multi-language speaker I know personally.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks c: !####$$##%POSITIVE
Is this a classroom or using Rosetta Stone?   Yes, either way it is awesome.####$$##%POSITIVE
No, it's available in the writing lab.  Can be used at anytime as long as a computer is open####$$##%POSITIVE
yes i learned basic German in 2 weeks great product thank you!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's the Lord's prayer! :D  Old English is awesome! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Great! Thanks for the feedback. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been learning ( Latin American)Spanish, and (Spain) Spanish on Rosetta Stone.  I would like to learn Italian.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well thank you! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Agreed! Shouldn't be hard to integrate the app for android market use!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I started Rosetta stone after having two exchange students from Germany. I thought I knew german, but I found out the german I learned as a child, was incomprehensible to them. So much for "  Pennsylvania Dutch" Now I can####$$##%POSITIVE
RS IS TOO EXPENSIVE. On the order of 200 bucks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
but being able to communicate with more people than you ever thought possible is priceless####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. Also, when you pick the TOTALe level 1-5 set, does this include the version 4 TOTALe? If not, how many users does each support with the purchase?####$$##%POSITIVE
The 5-level set is the verson 4 TOTALE if you are in the US, Canada, UK , or Japan.  You can put the program on two different computers and each computer can support 5 users (up to 10, total).  The online portion is good for 3 months (then you can renew, if you want) and is only good for one person.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow that is amazing. Congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats.  I already know I will get another language when I finish my current course.####$$##%POSITIVE
30 years ago, I studied in France for 2 months and could speak in the present and one past tense. Since then I lost it because I became more interested in Spanish. I also studied a month of Portuguese in Rio, the year before which I also lost. At this stage of my life I would like to return full circle and complete some of my goals from my past that I let go. I don't know if I will ever go to Brazil again and am sure I will not go to France but I do meet people in my travels that I could use both languages with instead of the sign language that I have been using to communicate. It is just for fun and to finish with goals that I had. Of course one can never be "finished" learning a language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, I will. It will be hard to leave my coaches in Portuguese. they were great! I hope the new ones in French will be just as nice and as much fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Knocking is a nice start.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanx####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice####$$##%POSITIVE
umm, not any in particular. it's that i come across them and have a hard time remembering them or there meaning. if i can have a solid English translation, i have an easier time remembering it.####$$##%POSITIVE
My husband and I did it before going to Italy a couple years ago and he proposed on the Ponte Vecchio - IN ITALIAN! Che Romantico!####$$##%POSITIVE
not far at all ;A; level 1 unit 2####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ashleigh, it was the sweetest thing ever! He had it planned for months :)####$$##%POSITIVE
If you feel you need to look up a word, look it up.  Get a dictionary, grammar books or anything else that might help you.  Learning a language is a lifelong journey, and you will have to do further study after RS.  I have a LOT of grammar books, and other resources for the languages that I am learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
Did that last summer ;) thanks rosetta stone####$$##%POSITIVE
definitely worth it. you will learn so much, and it's a lot more effective and cheaper than classes. You'll be amazed for sure - and it's a lot of fun, too.####$$##%POSITIVE
cool####$$##%POSITIVE
It depends what you want from it e.g. I want to back to Ecuador and do more vol work or full time job and travel, Also  you get as much out of it as you put in.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have just finished Level 1.  Definetly worth it.  Very fun, never feels like work, and I am amzaed at how much I do know now.  Moving on to level 2.####$$##%POSITIVE
yeah they should be allowed t feed back####$$##%POSITIVE
I have trouble staying motivated as well -- mainly due to the fact that I worry that I'll never learn or that I'm not using the right methods, or I'll just ultimately end up embarrassing myself when I try to speak the language (Brazilian Portuguese), and I still have these doubts now.  I've been using media quite a bit lately (music, television, news articles, etc) and they come in handy if you want to familiarize yourself. Possibly one of the ways to stay motivated is to keep practicing as often as you can, there are times when you just don't want to do it, and times when you're just passionate about learning as much as you can -- and you have to want to learn it, personally the learning experience is easier that way when you're passionate about something (this holds true for any subject, frankly).   The less you practice, the less likely you'll have that passion, which means you'll have a harder time with it. It's all about wanting to learn it, as often as possible, as much as possible. You seem very capable of doing this -- but you're the one in the driver's seat. Much luck to you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love to watch movies and listen to music in Spanish!  I can learn a lot from them and it gets me excited for when I'll be able to understand everything!  Plus, my goals for the future involve the language and learning more will help me achieve my goals.  :) ####$$##%POSITIVE
Irish is so hard but its so rewarding when you start making progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's well worth it. I am using the Chinese Rosetta Stone and I have learned so much.####$$##%POSITIVE
Gonna start on Arabic####$$##%POSITIVE
I know I get motivated if I can find a song I like in my new language, and learn the lyrics.####$$##%POSITIVE
Very Good! May God bless  you with His full protection.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've had this "same" problem for at least 18 months. Then...I did the most insanely simple thing I've ever done a few weeks ago and, since then, I've done at least 1 full hour per day. Once I get started, I'm in heaven...because I really enjoy the software, and the feeling of success it gives me as I progress through the lessons!  Believe it or not...I set an "alarm" on my cell phone. It's called "Rosetta Stone" (of course), and it goes off every day, 7x12, and it reminds me that its time to study.  Why this works...or won't work:   If you want to study, you just need to be reminded.  But, If you really don't want to study, then you are just going through the motions by crying out for help. That is really just another form of enabling yourself 'not' to study...and, believe it or not, 'everything' said here will only enable you 'not' to study. LOL  Do that...set an alarm, and give it the hour (or to the end of whatever goal you are on when that hour is up) it deserves. And, if you have to stop early...add the remaining time to the next study session to make it up.####$$##%POSITIVE
“In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” ~Dwight D. Eisenhower  For those who 'cannot' seem to find the time.  Then PLAN it out.  Think forward for each day...and set that time aside. It doesn't matter if you can't do the whole study allotment, as long as you plan and set the time aside.  Sooner or later, you'll settle into the time(s) that work best for you.  Lunchtime...no reason you can't eat lunch in front of the computer. Don't use a microphone for those sessions.  ... think! plan! do!  Break it up into 'goals'...if you are short on time, each goal has a general time (online). Give yourself goal oriented goals.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Tracie, that makes a lot of sense!  It will be very interesting to be teaching one language and learning another!  Hopefully I can save up for RS soon!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just remember how much you paid for the program :o)  Also, what motivated you in the first place is still there. Sometimes, after taking a break, it's hard to get going again. But if I try to use your language and I struggle, then that also serves as motivation to get back in the swing.####$$##%POSITIVE
how about going to the country of the language your learning? Italy here i come....  LOL    ok. i wasnt any help......####$$##%POSITIVE
Look at it this way. If learning a second language were easy, everyone would speak two or more languages. Because it is not easy, for the most part, this makes knowing a second language something of value.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree.  I am in level 5, and have yet to see a new story.  There should be about 2-3 new stories per level.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Way to go, Dante! Keep doing it brother!####$$##%POSITIVE

I know people like that.  I had teachers like that.  For awhile I went with what they said and studied Spanish but I didn't want to so I didn't do all that good.  I may one day learn it once I'm more confident in Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
am learning japannese find some words quite hard to say but am starting to link words with pictures , find understanding a bit easier than speaking but its early days and it will all get better , will keep on practising####$$##%POSITIVE
@Alex Rosetta Stone Success - Yes, every time I log on to RS, I need to click on the Level and Unit as it is always at Level 1 Unit 1. I contacted RS directly and they were unable to fix this issue. It wasn't a big deal to just click on the appropriate level. Are you saying I should redo the entire Level 1 Unit 1 work? Which activity do I need to repeat? It seems that others also have not seen new stories. (see above)####$$##%NEGATIVE
the amazing thing about rosetta stone is that no matter what language you are learning this program will change your life####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, I'm sick of the same Buzz Bingo stories too. Any simple fix?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok i will try with my computer this weekend so thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Jaime Rudberg, that is soo true! My native japanese friends in Rosetta World were shocked at my japanese. They think I speak very well.####$$##%POSITIVE

I think it is great for everyone to learn a second language.. My hats off to everyone who does... Rosetta Stone is a name you can trust!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both!####$$##%POSITIVE
My daughter loves this.####$$##%POSITIVE
I repeated the first core lesson for level 1 but it still hasn't fixed it.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I cannot wait to master German and then move onto Swedish. <3 I####$$##%POSITIVE
Not that hard actually hahaha. I love the language, which is why I always look forward to having the next lesson. Rosetta Stone rocks!####$$##%POSITIVE
German is realy difficult.####$$##%NEGATIVE
IMHO, any language is difficult to learn,and understand fluently.  Language is dynamic, and there is always something new to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, Portuguese is $379, not $500.####$$##%POSITIVE
German is extremely tedious. :P There are so many unnecessary things in German (such as about a million ways to say 'the' or 'a') but it's a very wonderful language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still working on Japanese Level 1 after one year but I take my time and have other language lessons to help.  Sometimes I need to know exactly what is being said instead of guessing if you know what I mean.  I keep a dictionary with me.  I love the language.  Rosetta Stone is fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thankyou Jessica!####$$##%POSITIVE
i live in hawaii, and i got my rosetta stone italian pretty fast!i think i think i got mine 3-5 days!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have just purchased RS Turkish and I am loving it.....it is very addictive but I find it frustrating thateven though i can match the pictures up to the words I only understand the key words and not the full meaning as there is no English translation.  I guess as I get further in to the course it all falls in to place :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am studying French right now, but once I finish I am going to buy RS for Danish :D Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you guys! I'm really excited, I just hope I don't get too frustrated.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice.  I would never have known that.####$$##%POSITIVE
It doesn't matter L or R. You can also skip using the microphone. Just unplug the Mic when the session starts and click "Disable Microphone for this Session"####$$##%POSITIVE
Thats very true :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Or you can make speech recognition precision easier: Pull-down menu>Set Preferences>Audio Settings tab>Speech Recognition Settings####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm assuming that you are using the microphone that came with RS?   It should be about on the level of your lips.   When you calibrate it before the first thing ... speak in a normal tone of voice, similar to how you speak in the exercises ... not differently.####$$##%POSITIVE
There is now a German Support Group/Forum.  Here is the website:  http://www.facebook.com/groups/234004253305594/####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm spending most of my last days of summer learning German. I. CAN'T. STOP! i share with my Mutter what i'm learning everyday and get excited when i write or speak a sentence and it is correct! but even though i am progressing, i am still extremely nervous to do the Duo or Simbio games, and i also am VERY nervous about the studio sessions...but i really want to though, i just cant shake my nerves.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have requested them too, more than once!####$$##%POSITIVE
You have to request it.  I believe that if enough people request it, they will consider production.  Here is the link:   http://www.rosettastone.com/global/form/language-request####$$##%POSITIVE
OK thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
Kamilla, I am looking for Norwegian too.  I will go to the link above to place a formal request.  I hope you will too!####$$##%POSITIVE
OK I did, anyway to know what languages are in production?####$$##%POSITIVE
They really don't say what is in process until they are ready to release it.  Everything is "top secret"!####$$##%POSITIVE
The easiest is hiragana and katakana. A lot of Manga is done in these.####$$##%POSITIVE
We should be able to use what we paid for.  No one ever told me these services expire after awhile, I thought you can use them when you are ready for them. I have used zero so far.####$$##%NEGATIVE
After learning hiragana, use it for learning kanji. It is very helpful. Mike Sessums, kanji is everywhere from manga to newspapers to novels in Japan.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys.  I've already learned hiragana and katakana so they shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Plus thanks to them, I'm starting to learn some of the kanji.  And I've also started spending time in Rosetta World.  And if I didn't have any problem with transferring the mp3s from my Audio Companion CD to my iPod, I'd use that too.  (Some of the files won't transfer for some reason even though I have them on my iTunes.)####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, I'm for the idea of Levels 4 and 5 for Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
Here is where you can put in requests for them to produce new languages.  This is where your request has a real effect. http://www.rosettastone.com/global/form/language-request####$$##%POSITIVE
Levels 4 & 5 take it further and give business vocabulary and just further vocabulary to express yourself.  1-3 is good, but I have German (and Italian), and both offer those two levels.  With German, the last two levels have really helped me out.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS can be difficult at the start - especially if you do not have a background in the language. It gets easier, and as you go through, you actually do retain a lot more than you think!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Janice, I took spanish in college but back then I wasnt serious about it, now I want to learn it, and even though Its getting a little hard, I still love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Recognition and passive learning acquisition is easy...Recall is much harder.  That is why Studio sessions are a must.  I have had to repeat Studio on some Units two or three times so that I felt comfortable speaking.  Repetition is the key to language learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh I`m glad to read that =), which language are u studying?####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish-Latin America (said with a smile).  It's soo easy to study/play !  Right now I'm major spring cleaning and taking breaks by sitting down and completing a lesson. Like now.  You should see the light bulbs above my head going off !  My son will soon choose a language to take in high school and I'm thrilled to know he will shine with help from Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like your comment about learning a new language is priceless.  That says it all.####$$##%POSITIVE
I was the same as you on Friday I had not completed the whole unit, but found it a lot of fun  and helpful I  had another one today####$$##%POSITIVE
I know, but I never find anyone online.  Wonder why!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Janice!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes sir :-]####$$##%POSITIVE
I am able to speak a language of love, like spanish...  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you rosetta stone, i am now able to communicate with the guys standing in front of home depot####$$##%POSITIVE
its awesome but its to freaking expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm also studying Brazilian Portuguese.  Love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
costs too much####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey, im the same, but only started today with level 1 German!  I did a qualification about 8 years ago though, so am finding it quite easy so far, but really enjoying it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too. It's been a lot of fun so far, and you'll find there is a TON of material to get through in Level One.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am almost finished with Level 5 of German.  I have two more units to go!  I speak over SKYPE with native speakers a couple of times a week.  Yesterday, I talked about the wearing of the Burqa in Europe and the US, as well as about religious freedoms.  I find that even though I know more complex grammatical structures, they do not always come to mind right away.  After about 1/2 an hour, I find that I am using them.  It is a great feeling!####$$##%POSITIVE
Dude I finished all and sometimes I think things in German before English.  You will be able to tell stories, answer and ask questions, debate, everything!####$$##%POSITIVE
Dan: I too just started level 2 of german.  good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
I like Rosetta Stone. Me gustaria tener contacto y sus programas.####$$##%POSITIVE
I understand. It just really was a bum deal to find this out. I feel for the new soldiers coming in who miss out on the opportunity to learn languages in such a well-taught way. The new stuff that the Army is offering is bogus.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i was bummed to find that out too when i tried to sign on today to continue learning italian!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree, but I also am a big believer in telling your elected officials.  If enough soldiers do it, the problem will be corrected.####$$##%POSITIVE
However, it is *easier* to learn a second language as a child.  There are cut-off points, after all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am disagree, you can adquire a new language at the young age not being more than 50####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
costs too much####$$##%NEGATIVE
well it has to be celebrities no one can understand. stallone, arnold shwarzenegger, jean claude van damme just to name a few. im glad you guys have a sense of humor####$$##%POSITIVE
Error 4111####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's a great idea! I just finished German a couple of weeks ago, but this would be fantastic to keep it in use!####$$##%POSITIVE
it didn't workout , I just bought it , I didn't downloaded it , so why should I  have this kind of problem ????####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm sooooo upset####$$##%NEGATIVE
There is no "Exam" ... really don't think of it that way.   It is a review and actually a condensing of what you learned to focus on the exact words.  I've had that experience of not recognizing a word only to find out that it really was in there after all.   This is really the same as the issue of hearing it differently than you read it.   As you go along and repeat the reviews, I'm pretty sure you won't be having these difficulties.  It gets easier.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone, I realize that retaining is my hardest challenge, I am going to finish the level 1 cd and do the whole cd again and again till I get it right.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Tracie.  I'll give SharedTalk a try.  @Alejandro, yo hablo ingles.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't know if continually repeating the same level over and over again is as productive as moving on and then going back.  Some of the things that you do not get now will "dawn on you" in later lessons.  I found that going on helps more than hurts.####$$##%POSITIVE
Janice is right.  Review is great but you always need to soldier on in your learning.  Please don't wait until you have everything perfect in each Level, Unit, Lesson...You will be surprised in future lessons when you finally realize that you DO understand a concept!  Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
It is recommended that people start with the 1st level, even if they have experience.  I believe that is a good idea because, though the material may be easy, you can get familiar with the program and how it works.  Also, if your daughter is 16 or older, she can take the studios.  It has been my experience that high school and college classes do not emphasize speaking skills as does RS.  The first level would allow her to re-build her skills.  I had 8 university classes in German, and then started RS.  I have vastly improved my aural-oral skills and have more confidence than I have in the past.  I went back to my German certificate program, and took the first test in less than 15 minutes! It was so much easier because I had the building blocks to figure out what was going on, and the extra (practical) vocabulary from RS.  To get a goo basis in a language, RS is an economical and convenient way to do just that!####$$##%POSITIVE
Very interesting.. I hope to become a fluent speaker of the Brazilian portuguese language very soon..####$$##%POSITIVE
I looked at the sharedtalk site.... very interesting!  Can't wait until I'm advanced enough to use it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I took French for a number of years in HS years (and years) ago but took RS French all 5 levels.  It was useful, even in the lower levels for review and then what came next made more sense since the learning builds.  You will go through the stuff that is review much faster than otherwise.####$$##%POSITIVE
I doubt that @Evelyn.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Crud I have Version 2....Thanks everyone.  I learned a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
Have fun####$$##%POSITIVE
You will love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had the same problem. But I just went through it once with a lot of errors trying to predict what they meant, until I saw the pattern. If the images are focusing on clothes/  Colors etc... and then I go it. Its a bit frustrating I know, but i guess that is what immersion is about.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with William.  I do the same thing.  I don't like the standard program.  It leaves out too many exercises.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks eveyone. both sound like good options. I may just give each a try.####$$##%POSITIVE
may be able to get the files from my laptop.  not sure. Will have boyfriend look at it later today.  thanks.  :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeh I'm with Liz too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Liz, Liam and DIana.  When are done with the regular lession and then redue with the extended version do u start all over?  I seem to get very confused when i go back and look at things I have done. It changes my lession plan?  I think"####$$##%NEGATIVE
i will from now on.  arggg####$$##%NEGATIVE
btw what are you going to do about china bootleggin your software and sellin it for penies####$$##%NEGATIVE
its a  pain hopefully  RS will update it so   progress is mor easily transferable####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats the next language I am getting after I get the spanish down.####$$##%POSITIVE
Really???Have fun in Japan! xD####$$##%POSITIVE
I'll be pretty much visiting most of the regions, and seeing the historic sights and if i'm lucky go to a festival or two. I'm just hoping the Yen stays stable till then.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Judy - studios are great fun.  You will feel some Angst the first time, but I know quite a few people who are addicted to them! I admit, I feel a little uneasy in the beginning of each one - not because of the studio, but I want to see who is in it with me!####$$##%POSITIVE
Would, but cant afford the price of it right now####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think it's a little extreme but it's a total shame that sometimes we such at our own language! and because of that we also suck at others, I've noticed that if you don't have a good Ortography in your own language then you might have also difficulties with another one :S####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sr####$$##%NEGATIVE
the russian one is challenging i would agree i just kept on repeating before i moved on to make sure i got the word or words just right practice makes perfect and im sure you can do it####$$##%POSITIVE
Dont worrry Jennifer, you will get it, I have the spanish version, and even though spanish is a little easier than russian, I sometimes have trouble remembering everything, but you will be suprised how much you learned.####$$##%POSITIVE
costs too much####$$##%NEGATIVE
It just hangs and hangs and hangs (grey rectangle, white round circle spinning) when I click Schedule a Studio Session.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Been through everything in the last 4 days with tech support - I'm connected!!  Can sign onto totale.rosettastone.com with no problem so it doesn't make sense that the desktop app can't do the same thing!####$$##%NEGATIVE
there is now a team of engineers discussing the issue - they've seen it once before but it's not exactly the same as last time so they're working through it and we'll be on the phone again this afternoon!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats weird, I thought I saw it on the website, maybe I was seeing things.####$$##%NEGATIVE
well, well, well.... Looks like my internet provider (Rogers... for all you Canucks out there) seems to be causing the problem.  We installed it all on a laptop, tried using it at home with the same annoying results and then I went off to McDonald's (where Bell wifi is free) and it worked perfectly.  Now it's up to the cable company to fix a "provisioning error" that was on my account, whatever that means.####$$##%POSITIVE
I use it every day and love it!  I have about a 45 minute drive to work, so that is an hour and a half a day.  Really helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
No, you won't but you will have to go back and do certain sections that were not included when you started.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok :) Thank you so much for helping!####$$##%POSITIVE
Jens, that is exactly what I did. And as James says, you won't lose your progress. However, you do not "have" to go back; the added activities will simply show as not yet completed; and, of course, you may go back and complete them. Actually, in my case, since I am a bit "retentive", I went back and restarted the whole course from scratch, although at the time I was only half-way through Level 1. Have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
You can go back and do them at will. Now, whether the application will consider units with activities not yet done to be incomplete, I do not know; I went back and did all new activities that were added when I switched to Extended mode.####$$##%POSITIVE
ROSETTA STONE, I am sure that your company spent millions of dollars in advertising in your newest TV ads that we have all seen lately! Instead of doing that, why don't you spend that money where it is needed that is with your Arabic lessons! Your Arabic lessons need to be updated in order to keep up with the latest trends in teaching!!!!  Many Arabic countries are teaching the ENGLISH LANGUAGE as a 2nd language and also as the main language in many college classes, so why don't you teach us with the ENGLISH LANGUAGE as well! I speak English as my primary language, so I learn in the English language as well too and so do many other people.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You listen to a native speaker say something and then select a picture that goes with what was said.   It is outstanding at listening to you, analyzing what you said, showing you where your pronunciation is off.  This also helps with listening.   Then there is conversational exercises with longer phrases to listen to.  In Rosetta World there are stories with text which you listen to and / or follow the text.  Finally and most important are coaching sessions with real live native speakers who you converse with while watching them on a live web cam ... they are very patient and will work with you, repeating and helping you to get what they are saying.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've started to study american english, i am on unit 3, level 1, I feel that my writting and speaking is getting better, thanks for help, i trust RS and i really think it can improve my english in little time.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's commets like these that make me feel ashamed to live in America. I am a Nigerian who NOT only understands Yoruba and English, but a bit of Spanish to survive there and some French..in pogress. Just because i already know 2 languages, doesn't mean I'll stop there. On a side note, i'm INLOVE with french. there's just something about that langauge that makes me happy. Merci beaucoup, RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
You don`t even have to ask!!! do it!! I`ll be glad to join too####$$##%POSITIVE
I am interested too!!####$$##%POSITIVE
OURS OF COURSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!XD####$$##%POSITIVE
You didn't mention entering the license keys.  Did you receive license keys with your product?  Otherwise, you will have to wait until they are open for business Monday.   Incidentally there are unscrupulous types selling illegal copies of RS without the keys.  If you paid signficantly less than retail for your copy - you may have been ripped off.####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, you will be able to communicate with people from Latin America.  I speak Spanish after spending time in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as a child.  I speak with people from Spain both over SKYPE and face-to-face.  Some of the vocabulary is different, but we completely understand each other.  A decent parallel is British English and American English.  I understand most British English, but they have words and phrases that are different.  I admit that I have problems with some American English because of the accent or vocabulary.  I do believe, though, that if you are really nervous about it, it would be better to switch.  After all, the Spanish did colonize most of Latin America!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok, I already ordered the Spanish from spain, but I read that even if you learn the spanish from spain, you can still communicate with the other spanish speaking people, I cant wait for it to get here.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok, I wish they had this program when I was growing up.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am excited, once I learn it on this program, I will be able to learn portuguese easier.####$$##%POSITIVE
But we LOVE our teachers in the studio sessions!  They make it a wonderful experience.####$$##%POSITIVE
Here is my idea along a similar line.  That RS sponsor "Immersion weekends".  These would happen at hotels around the country and feature food, film, coaches and require people stick to their language.  I'm thinking there would be several RS languages represented concurrently at the same facility then at the end, it would be open to friends and family.   There would be a charge for this but it could be really worth while if done right both for the learners and as a promo for RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks. Chinese.####$$##%POSITIVE
That would also be cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I did! is that good? lol####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome! thank you (:####$$##%POSITIVE
Aaron---I'd love it. So far, I have had techs who have gone in a complete circle - only re. the 1141 error (which seems to have gone away), but are not dealing with the major issue which wouldn't let me into the session. I did finally get into my session the other day and I have another tomorrow morning. If you are available after that session, I will be able to let you know how it went--re. the connection, that is!! :-)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Aaron...I just had a studio session that everything worked perfectly! I appreciate your offer of help and I know where to find you if the problem returns!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Mark, I love your idea for studio x.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Aaron!  All is well for now!####$$##%POSITIVE
okay thanks a bunch!! (:####$$##%POSITIVE
I might add, studio x is also a great idea.  I think it should be limited to persons who have completed all available Studios for the units in the course.####$$##%POSITIVE
Perhaps upon completion of studio 5-4, a popup could appear to allow one to register using a credit card. ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just looked at the original price tag on my copy and it says $579 I paid $311, so I actually saved well over $200! As much as I hate the fact that my favorite bookstore is going out of business, I'm super happy that such a great thing for me has come out of it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Geoffrey - in order to participate in Studio X or any other further program, you MUST have completed either Level 3 (for programs with only one level) or Level 5 (for programs with 5 levels).  Also, just a thought, what about a contest where people who have completed the last level available are eligible for an expense-paid trip to a/the country where the language is spoken??####$$##%POSITIVE
Oooh janice - I love that idea.   That would be a great promotion.####$$##%POSITIVE
We hope u follow up with studio x.  I have never found anyone in rosetta world to speak with who is fluent in my language of study####$$##%NEGATIVE
I realize that the format would have to be somewhat different, but I would still be interested in it all the same.  Thanks for the link, I will do that - I previously requested levels 4 and 5 of Russian, and now look what you have. ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Dennis.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it is that.   Remember, the point is what you learn and you can always repeat these exercises as a rigorous test.  I would much rather finish with a score that might be a little more than I deserve but words learned that I might not have.   Later, if you want to test yourself, don't use the hints but don't miss out on using that feature to really build up what you know.  Of course all this is personal philosophy and different people may have different learning styles.####$$##%POSITIVE
DO IT! The course is a great compliment to whatever your current studies are, and you can't beat speaking with coaches who are native speakers.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just started doing the Rosetta Stone russian the other day; It is fun yet challenging. I'm beginning to understand.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah Do it.  I got the arabic package and it is outstanding.   I have now followed it up (as I think Taylor has) with more advanced courses to build our skills further.  Text book intended for college is now a piece of cake on my own.   As for it being hard, in some ways it's easy.  For examples: there is a near perfect correspondence between a single accented letter and a sound.  Romance languages you basically have to learn multiletter groups.   Also Arabic uses a system of roots with many words having related meaning with the same root.  Getting from  a root to different forms of noun, adjective, verb etc. is fairly consistent   Once you learn to spot this you learn one word and you actually have learned 20.    Another thing ... if any language were harder than others it would take babies longer to learn it.  All children start speaking at the same age.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you both for the advice. It is very appreciated####$$##%POSITIVE
That sucks.  I was really hoping there was a 1-5.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've used Pimsleur, classes and RS, and I have found RS the most useful.  It does help to pick up cyryllic cursive while you are at it.  There are examples on the web or just photocopy the pages from an old intro Russian textbook from your closest public or college library.####$$##%POSITIVE
will do, thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Though I don't have RS Russian, I do have three other languages.  I firmly believe that I have learned more through RS than through courses and other software/audio programs.  I treat it like an actual course and print out the transcripts that they provide, put them in  a binder, and use the transcripts as reference during the studios, and during the focus lessons.  I admit that I have grammar books and a dictionary for one language, but I am also finishing up a program in that language. I have grammar tests and have to explain grammar points and translate.  I believe that your son will have excellent progress in Russian with RS.  He does need to avail himself of the studios and play the games in Russian as that solidifies his knowledge.  The course is fun, and you can easily sit through an hour without realizing it.  Have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just did it.  Thanks!  Love the Rosetta Stone method of learning a foreign language.  Am just at a stand still right now.  Hope they respond.  Thanks again.####$$##%POSITIVE
Perfect! Thanks for the tip. Now I am off to brush up on my Italian.####$$##%POSITIVE
if you go on your AKO and search Rosetta stone, an Army E-learning thing will be like the first thing the search finds, and it tells you how to set it up. and completing all the levels increases your pay (:####$$##%POSITIVE
I love learning German but the grammer is certainly a challange####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I will... He's trying to learn as many languages as he can before he leaves for the Marine Corps next June. I will keep everyone updated. THANKS GUYS!!! It should be getting here by UPS today. Whoot!####$$##%POSITIVE
That keeps happening with my studio sessions too. It's annoying because u can't leave thoughtful feedback because u have to close window to see final screens of sessikn####$$##%NEGATIVE

Not all language-learning materials are created equally.####$$##%POSITIVE
Nicholas - why don't you tell us what you learned ... you were too busy being unpleasant to tell us what you accomplished.   I would be interested in learning what this was because I have looked at a variety of ways of learning language and actually, this one is the most effective in term of what you learn and the time it takes to learn it.  Instead of being negative, share this marvel you claim to know of and what it has taught you.####$$##%POSITIVE
You sure are a Troll ... I knew that.   Nothing funny about it, except in your own mind.  Now be a grownup and delete your insipidly stupid and childish post.####$$##%POSITIVE
Everyone has a different way of learning anything, some people learn fast, and some people it takes time, and when it comes to learning a language, it bascially about patience and repetition. Actually this product use to cost more back in the day and plus you can choose the pay plan, you cant beat that, and to get the best you have to buy the best. BTW even if you are a child, it doesnt mean that you have to be mean. In general, to each its own.####$$##%POSITIVE
I know English (of course) and Spanish. My parents immigrated to the United States. So, they only taught me Spanish at home and I learned English at school when I grew up. Right now I'm in the military. My ultimate goal in life is to go to college for East Asian Studies (and I'm using Rosetta Stone so that way it can boost me up on my Japanese and I don't have to struggle as much once I start on Japanese language college courses), get my degree and to become an English teacher in either Japan or South Korea.####$$##%POSITIVE
Melissa, sometimes, if you plug in your USB headset *after* you start the Rosetta Stone application, it will not recognize the headset. First plug in your headset, and *then* start Rosetta Stone. That's how it works on my MacBook Pro.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh thank you, i will try now : )####$$##%POSITIVE
noooo...bugga tried that and still nothing, i don't get it?? how could it have worked and now nothing??? and how could it work on my husbands home site and not mine?? bizzar?? oh well, I'm up for suggestions so bring them on if you have a minute ; ))####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hang in there Diana. It can be very intimidating when you are asked words that you have not been taught.  I find that if I ask the Coach to write on the computer screen it helps. Of course in what ever language you are learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
5 levels of RS run about $499 plus tax.  I am in the fifth level, and it has done wonders for my speaking and comprehension.  I LOVE the studios and the stories.  Unlike the classes that I took at the university, the learning is geared to me - not some syllabus.  They offer a 5-payment plan with 0% interest and allow you to return - no questions asked - within 6 months of purchase.  It is really a course, but it is fun and you really learn a lot.  Each level has 4 units and each unit has 4 lessons plus focus lessons (vocabulary, speaking, grammar, pronunciation, etc.).####$$##%POSITIVE
Please consider the dialects in the German language.  @ Rosetta Stone: how about making a level 6a for e.g. common unique phrases in Swiss German, 6b for common/unique phrases in Austrian/Bavarian German? Just the common phrases. I am sure this would be appreciated by the user community. If you need a native speaker let me know :)                  And making special versions from Rosetta Stone for e.g. Engineers or Medical Doctors could also be a great idea!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Dennis, I appreciate it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Everyone who uses Rosetta Stone is a student.   There are schools and libraries who have Rosetta Stone available for free or a very low fee.   RS is actually less expensive for what you learn than a typical college course that would provide the same.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS offers a 5-payment plan with 0% interest.  They do not have a discount for students, or any other group (e.g., senior discount).  After a point, I would think,  it would get too onerous to determine whether those who apply really qualify for the discount. The product is worth the price, so a person can either save for it, get involved with the payment plan or look for a more cost effective alternative.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had to sign up a second time to get the link.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks.  I'll try that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm not sure how this conversation became so hostile, But I believe the main topic was just an inquiry about offering student discounts. Microsoft Office and Apple offer student discounts for their products and it is very helpful. A lot of students I know often struggle with finding resources to compliment their college education. I understand the 5-payment plan, but for students without a steady income that is not exactly a doable scenario. We're just looking for a hand-up wherever we can find one.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I still haven't received a confirmation email so have no idea how to go about attending.  I did what RS Success suggested but haven't gotten a confirmation as yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They offer discounts for educational institutions, but that wouldn't help you. One thing that may help, if you can afford to  wait, they lower their prices during the month of April. The customer service rep told me they do this annually. You may want to double check, though by calling them.####$$##%POSITIVE
OH! okay! thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I use the program with Windows 7.  Love the online services.  The games really help and the studio sessions are very unique.####$$##%POSITIVE
The online is cheaper, but the CDs allow you have the program forever and can keep going back.  I use Windows Vista, for two of the programs, but Windows 7 for another program, and it works fine with the CDs.  Maybe, someone from RS can comment on this (when they see it!)####$$##%POSITIVE
for most people, if you are realistic about how long you will need to use RS to achieve your goal, the online version is not a savings.  It's biggest advantage is that you can use it wherever you have web access and the CD version you can use only on two machines.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Everyone......!####$$##%POSITIVE
i sing in rosseta stone.i rty 2 online classes.so, guys help me.####$$##%POSITIVE
I speak mandarin:)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm not sure how much this would help, but my 11 year old is doing fine using the arabic cd on his own. :)####$$##%POSITIVE

Listen, I'm still waiting to receive the promised Beta-version testing kit that was to be sent to me....   I even have e-mails asking for shipping details, but.... no software!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Consider that every language is learned by babies at the same age.####$$##%POSITIVE
If I had the spare money, I'd get Korean & French & Tagalog & Spanish, and maybe German. But I must wait####$$##%NEGATIVE
Have you looked at their 0% interest five payment plan?  I'm not sure what you mean by "hard way" but a college course where you get the same conversational proficiency is more expensive.  A book + CD kit ... I've tried. Good luck, because I doubt anyone can get good proficiency from those and so they are actually a waste of money.####$$##%POSITIVE
i would just like to reassure anyone wanting to use Rosetta stone for their children that it is absolutely the way to go, the intuitive pedagogy really resonates with them and they truly love the interaction. each step is planned out so well and the rhythm of the course as a whole is brilliantly thought out. we have had the spanish totale version now for 1 week and we are all rockin! it has cost us $60 an hr for a private tutor and the knowledge we have gained from Rosetta stone has already paid itself off. so big rap from us.

Got mine today thanks ... Gracias####$$##%POSITIVE
Just tried the demo and I LOVE it!! I just can't decided between doing French first or Italian####$$##%POSITIVE
Well grants are available, but its hard when your a stay home mom to go and get the education elsewhere.  Like i said I am trying to save the money to do this.  I really really liked the demo.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Wendy - RS is especially useful when you cannot control your own schedule.  With college classes, you have to go when the class is on and you have to complete assignments on time.  With RS, you have more flexibility though I think you still need to have about 4-5 hours every week in 1/2 hours plus segments to really make progress.   It also may be that learning a language is ultimately an investment as it definitely makes your services more valuable in many kinds of business.  Time is still the real investment in any kind of language learning though RS needs less of it for the same effect (in my opinion).####$$##%POSITIVE
Have you looked at their 0% interest 5 payment plan?   Truth is, if you want to learn a language, relative to what you learn, it's the least expensive.####$$##%POSITIVE
delete. send me a free copy!! I will promote for you.####$$##%POSITIVE
And I'm trying to learn Japanese for my 3rd language through Rosetta Stone. =D####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, I'm not discouraged at all. I'm determined to make Japanese my 3rd language and I'm using Rosetta Stone to boost me up. =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thanks, are you going to be taking on new projects at any point?####$$##%POSITIVE
Will do.####$$##%POSITIVE

7:45 AM still having same problems.  crossing fingers it gets resolved soon?????####$$##%NEGATIVE
Christy, I don't know if this is related, but I was asked to update my program about a month ago or so, and it became noticeably slower during the syncing process- sometimes 3-4 min. Syncing happens when I return to the main menu from a lesson. Last night was first time I saw the connection problem, however.####$$##%NEGATIVE
glad to hear it as i do have a couple of questions and would like to know other learners of Italian...####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks so much for the info!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, it's now an hour later and I'm still getting the message. I click OK but it doesn't show any players. I can go ahead and use the course but no players are showing up. I did update my software last week as I got an on screen message to do so. If it still happens tomorrow, I'll give tech support a try. I tried "Live Chat" tonight and got someone, but they never responded back after I told them what was going on.  Frustrating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was having the same problem.  Could see poeple coming in and leaving.  A couple of times I got a match but the connection never came through :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am Having the same problems its been like this for 2-3 hours now####$$##%NEGATIVE
when i open the program I get the Cannot connect to server, and if i try to compleat 1 of the lessons i get the same message when it tries to sync & then it wont acknowledge that i compleated the lesson. so i try using my ipad to work on some lessons & i get a little into a lesson then i get a screen that tells me my email or pass word is wrong & kickes me out of the rosseta ipad app. I guess im gonna have to give up for now & try tomorrow & see if they have this fixed up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I saw zero players listed and finally gave up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, Dennis.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's just frustrating. Have had difficulty lately finding game players so wanted to make sure to attend Game Night and it didn't work out.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Donald, I have only tried the Portuguese RS, and I love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
That sounds good. How old is he?####$$##%POSITIVE
He's 1 year old.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's good to know.  I'm glad to hear he's learning at such a young age especially when people tell my parents to not teach kids that young.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi. I am on level 2 French. And it's opposite for me, I can understand the speech, but i have a little unsecurety with speaking and specially with spelling(. But I do watch a lot of movies and shows on French. And it was the same for me with English and now i speak fluently on it (except i still have spelling issues sometimes) , so it's different for everybody, everybody have different abilities. So keep practicing and you will get it) Good luck####$$##%POSITIVE
It will come in time with more experience.  Just keep listening to different speakers, perhaps repeating some of the exercises, studio sessions.  It all helps.   Practice making sentences with what you know. This also helps you parse new sentences with the words you learned.  As you do things in your daily life, try reporting them to yourself in your new language, especially if they are similar to RS exercises.####$$##%POSITIVE
News shows, especially local TV news in Spanish, are great for understanding.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to say thanks for everyone's feedback.  It is very encouraging.   I can't wait to understand Spanish spoken at a fast rate.  I am tired of saying, "Puede hablar mas despacio, por favor?"####$$##%POSITIVE
You learn them by using them as the forms are introduced. Part of the point of Rosetta stone is that it is not traditional classroom methodology. Trust me on this one, it's much more effective in the long run####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok...I'll continue as I have! Just hope I can remember the tenses!####$$##%POSITIVE
So, just to clarify for me and for Pam,  RS is saying that I am somehow going to start remembering all of these different verb conjugations/ tenses and when to use them?  Yes, this is why I bought the program, and I was fine through Level 1.  When I got to Level 2 and the past/future tense unit, I have started  panicking a bit.  I moved ahead to Unit 3 of that level, which I've completed and was much easier than Unit 2, but I have to admit I'm getting concerned and don't feel very confident anymore like I did all through Unit 1.  So, RS, I am really NOT supposed to start making/finding flashcards, other apps, internet sources, etc., to learn this stuff?  I'm just supposed to use the program and by Level 5 will be...... "conversationally acceptable"?  Do I have this right, RS?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thankyou####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, right, paying $600 to do something you could effectively do on the Internet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It hasn't been down for months.  Is it possible that you did not renew your subscription?####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't even have Rosetta stone for a year now...I got it on Christmas. Why do I need to renew? I own it I thought the app was free?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Learn as many languages fluently as you can,they can take you a long way and give you a great advantage and opportunities.####$$##%POSITIVE
Attrice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Actually, there is a way; If you have Version 4 TOTALe, and have access to the online features, you have access to "Stories"; as you progress in the Course, the stories unlock using words you've learned, as well as challenging you with new words in the Stories.  Stories will tell you about the culture, maybe some nursery rhymes, describe food, tell about landmarks, different ways to use the words you've learned, other such things; and, because its Rosetta Stone, they'll do that all without translation!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much, submitted the request####$$##%POSITIVE

I am in Brazil and my iTunes account is from Mexico. The "Roseta Stone, Ltd." application does not exist in the iTunes search menu :(  I sent an application request but I did not get any answer.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats what I want to do, I want to learn spanish, portuguese, estonian, Lithuanian, and possibly chinese, but there is only two schools in the US that teach Estonian and Lithuanian, and I just ordered the Spanish rosetta stone to start off with, I know its going to take a long time but anything you want bad enough is worth the wait.####$$##%POSITIVE
"The Ugly American"??? Well, really thats a cultural and political problem... I know a lots of american people and I think you are lovely... is just that there are many things arround the world and some how you can find american interests inside them that makes many people thik bad of you.  It's not my case...  But this is not the place to talk about... If you want my help with Spanish just contact me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
When you consider the 250 hours, also consider the time that it takes to do the studios and play the games. Two studios a week would add another 2 hours a week to your studies.  I started level 1 the second week of April, and got 1/2 way through level 5 by the end of August.  I spent about 1 1/2 hours a day.  I haven't had the time lately to finish level 5, but if I had continued, I would have finished by the end of August/beginning of September. That would have been about 5 months.  Also, I played a lot of the games, and took about 30+ studios during that time. Hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
Level two is intense because it introduced future and past tenses.  I think that it does for all, if not most, languages.  That can get a little daunting, but by the time you get through it, it is so much easier.####$$##%POSITIVE
i finished level 1 in Spanish today... maravillos####$$##%POSITIVE
Felicidades, Mostafa!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias,yaritza####$$##%POSITIVE
Felicitaciones Motafa, ese es un gran paso. Mucha suerte en tu estudio.####$$##%POSITIVE
complete sentences are difficult for me too.  i'm just beginning level 3. i do find that things are being to "click" and i am encouraged my that####$$##%POSITIVE
You can have as many as you want as long as your subscription is active.  There is no limit.####$$##%POSITIVE
One point - you can only sign u p for 2 studios at a time, and only one at the same level.  Other than that, you can have as many as you can fit in!####$$##%POSITIVE
Muchas gracias,yaritza :)####$$##%POSITIVE
The Rosetta Stone community is just great!  The information and encouragement is so helpful.  I was doing one studio per unit per level.  Now that I know that I can do more studios I am going to try to do more since it might help to get the sentences out.  Gracias!####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish bc im required to-.-####$$##%NEGATIVE
it's exellent graham...i've learned alot so far after lvl 1####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Graham, I've done really well with RS with Spanish - Latin America.  I've been very busy lately and have not been able to keep up on the program like i should but having completed Level 1, I have picked up a LOT of the language.   Get all 5 levels and you won't be disappointed.  Buena Suerta!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it is worth! Get the whole package! You will love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm currently in Level 2 and completely amazed by RS.  I only bought levels 1 and 2 because I wanted to make sure I liked it first before buying the whole set, but I wish I had bought all five levels at once - less expensive that way.  Still, I will be buying the remaining levels because it is so worth it.  Personally, I vote for the cd versions as well, because you own them forever and can continue to review.  I believe the online subscription expires at some point.  Of course, the online services (different than the subscription) of games and studio sessions are included in each level you purchase (3 months, renewable).  Hope this is helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
That was even funnier than I was expecting.####$$##%POSITIVE
I kept getting a message that thanked me for joining this evening, but no webinar.  I gave up after about 30 minutes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I could not get into the survey..said 20% then went back.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Steve..I feel the same way...what is your Spanish (LA) level?  Maybe we can coordinate a game time####$$##%NEGATIVE
Chinese = worst language ever.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've completed level 3 unit 2.  Been studying for 4 months, and I don't think I've ever seen a coordinated game night.  I think setting up a time would be a great idea.  With the lack of Simbio opportunities, I use Studio a lot, but would like to get experience speaking outside Studio as well.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I cannot get the survey open ... Are there technical difficulties?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the info. Look forward to receiving my RS package ####$$##%POSITIVE

Taking German for my language requirement in college.  And I am very interested in the German Culture.  It offers an opportunity to learn where my family's background comes from.  I think Rosetta Stone will be an extra tool that I can use to gain a deeper understanding of the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Will do!####$$##%POSITIVE
Having the same problems here too Cindy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't get into the webinar :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
rosetta stone makes everythings easier for learning a new language , cauZ it uses pics snd characters togheter,so theres no need to use any dictionary....it works like a picture dictionary!!!:)) I could learn my fav language so easier than I imagined!!!!:X####$$##%POSITIVE
They send a certificate of completion after level 3 and/or level 5.  The certificates are cool and are about 8 1/2 by 11.  They come out of Illinois (at least mine did), and with a cardboard back.  Perfect for framing!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just got mine today. Thanks RS!####$$##%POSITIVE
Merci beaucoup####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rosetta stone, i wish i could get your opinion :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh ok thanks Janice, I want to learn german too, I was stationed in germany for almost 3 yrs and I did pick up some, but I forgot most of it since its been 8 yrs since I lefted, even doe english and german are in the same family, I think german is harder cause you have masculine, femine, and neutral.####$$##%POSITIVE
got it, thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Buy it direct from http://rosettastone.com or from one of their mall kiosks which they identify on that site.  If you buy it from a retailer you may not get the six months no questions asked policy RS offers if you are not completely satisfied.   The kiosk will also give you a very nice demo.####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald, don't memorize as a task.  Just repeat the lessons as you like and eventually it will just naturally stay with you.  You will learn best if you are just relaxed and enjoying yourself.  The great thing about RS is that you can repeat what you like and nobody is watching.  Be patient and it will come.####$$##%POSITIVE
Found it! Yay! Thanks! Yeah, otherwise, LOVE this program, just feel that should've been automatic####$$##%POSITIVE
I am also learning Spanish (LA) and found the same thing.  However, keep at the lessons, keep practicing in RW and don't forget to attend Studio (I think it's the best aspect of Rosetta Stone online...I try to attend 3 or 4 sessions a week).  You'll be surprised how much easier the milestones are if you come back to them and try them again as you progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Spanish, and eventually I want to learn Portuguese so I travel to every Spanish and Portuguese speaking country, and so when I go back to school, I want to either take up International Business, or do something in the travel industry, and learning these languages will make me look marketable, and plus I love latin women, especially brazilian women.####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't speak English until I was 3 but never took schooling in my native language of Spanish, so though I can understand and speak it correctly, reading and writing are beyond me. I'm learning this so that I'm fluent in all aspects so that, when I have my own children, I can teach it to them and they can be fully exposed to the Hispanic part of their heritage. After Spanish, I'll be learning French to read some of the great classics in their true language and Mandarin simply b/c it's a good world language to have.####$$##%POSITIVE
you guys are awsome thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. A "Milestone" this is a conversation between you and the computer.  2. A Studio session. this is a ~50-minute live session with a person who is a native of the language you're learning.  You can also play games (solo or with another person) to help that as well.  That's in Rosetta World.####$$##%POSITIVE

ROSETTA STONE:  (PLEASE FORWARD TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS DEPARTMENT.)

It just makes me really mad that I have spent this much, but then have to realize I have to spend more, as I was saying, I don't have the money to buy the package and I can't be spending $25 a month either and once my computer goes down, I'm done and I can't use it at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am learning Farsi, though different is similar to arabic.  I am on level 2 unit 2.  The first few units were very difficult.  Just keep going and it will come to you what it is trying to teach.  When I finally finished level 1 I went back to the beginning and started over and realized a lot of things that I had missed the first time through.  Good luck####$$##%POSITIVE
Pay a lot of attention to how many people are in the picture, what their gender(s) are and where the speaker is gesturing.   In Arabic there is a difference between 1, 2, and more than 2 things in how a word ends.   I assume you just hit the one with all the flowers being held and handed off?   That takes awhile. As you go through other lessons, you will see these forms used again, return to the exercise and you will get it eventually.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thks Geoff :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for looking into the pricing.  The HS pricing for individual levels is still too high for me.  It makes loyal customers like me feel like those customers in the "Ally Bank" commercials where only new customers get a deal.  Please let me know what you can work out.   -Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm not learning Spanish, but I'm also at Level 2 (Chinese).  It is not as scary as you would think.  There seems to be an accumulating effect taking place.  You know more than you think.  Go ahead!####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes i want learn spanish Rosetta Stone :)))))))))####$$##%POSITIVE
That's awesome Dennis! I'm hoping RS will teach me Russian so it is as good as your English after I've finished learning German####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm looking forward to getting it!!!  I called concierge services simply because it wasn't making sense and they told me to wait until Level 2.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought a new laptop and that solved the problem :D thanks though.####$$##%POSITIVE
buena suerte :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I have, they are a lot of fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Lauren, it is fun learning another language.  I have always enjoyed Rosetta Stone.  The program used to be available at our local libraries until the contracts ended.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Russian (an entirely new alphabet at that), and I'm picking it up easily.  I believe the money's worth it if you do indeed want to learn a new language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Def worth it!####$$##%POSITIVE
That's exactly how it works, ultimately without thinking "translation" but just having it in your head.   I've had words pop in my head from languages I am learning and I didn't "Know" what they meant but then realized after a minute, that I was looking at an example of that thing in real life instead of RS.   It's a strange sensation.####$$##%POSITIVE
More than worth it! IT really helps you understand and speak the language.  TO me, communicating with people in my new language (people who don't speak any other language in common) is priceless!####$$##%POSITIVE
You should ask for a link to the demo! I'm learning Latin at school, but I wish we did it the Rosetta Stone way! It's soooo much better! (I tried the demo; it was fantastic!)####$$##%POSITIVE
i so totally want the Tagalog version of Rosetta Stone! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
My german should be delivered today. Looking forward to it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Tagalog is my next language to learn after Korean!! And I'm half Filipino!! Lol ####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck, Lisa! It's a very challenging language but that's part of what makes it so fun to learn!####$$##%POSITIVE
This is me! I'm surrounded completely by Filipinos all the time and I agree, even though you are right there with them it feels like you are 100 miles away, so isolated! That's why I'm learning now :)####$$##%POSITIVE

I wonder how it feels to study more than one RS, after studying spansih, I really want to get the portuguese RS, but I guess I better wait till I finish paying the spanish one first.####$$##%POSITIVE
I second Janice's suggestion regarding higher level techs.  I am sure you are aggravated, but stick with it... They will stick with you until the problem is solved and you will really like the program.  Worth the tech issue.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeh kinda annoying!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can sign into Totale online, but it sticks at "Please Wait While We Check Your System" so it's useless.  So it's RS's software, system checks, etc. - everything else works.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes - and when I change languages, it takes another minute or so!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was on the phone with the higher level techs for nearly 4 hours. AVG PAID runs a virus scan every day - the techs did the flushdns thing and there were no changes. RS software opens, tries to sync to RS servers and can't.  No explanation besides that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, have tried both and still getting it.  When I click start Rosettastonedaemon I get a box come up with 'error 1053 servive did not respond to the start or control  request in a timely fashion'####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is escalated, but it's taken me 35 minutes on hold to get to the escalations people and I'm still on hold.  Really... there should be a direct line I can call since I've already wasted so much of my time, updated the ticket and had no response.  FRUSTRATING!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't know if connected to the problem but I've started getting an error messgae on starting computer saying something to do with ''applesync notifier'####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, it is very addicting!####$$##%POSITIVE
Have checked date and time, and nothing has changed with my antivirus recently so I assume it couldnt be that?####$$##%NEGATIVE

I didn't buy it, but I have been enjoying and benefiting from watching the Health Channel of Brazilian TV on-line. And, I am planning a trip to Brazil or Portugal soon.####$$##%POSITIVE
there are a few apps for the ipad (or iphone) which are helpful and fun.  I use them when I have to wait - kid is at sports practice, car being fixed.  They are free or just a couple of bucks in cost.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought French verbs for dummies as well as renting French films and books. RS is great but doesn't explain verbs and so I needed support with that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Pretty good! I've been practicing my pronunciation with Chinese natives. I even have friends on FB who I can ask grammar questions! My Chinese friend in America even gave me my chinese name. It's pronounced mei-kuh like my original name and written 美柯。 It means beautiful (^_^)####$$##%POSITIVE
nice####$$##%POSITIVE
RS also does not really teach/introduce culture.  It is good to read articles, and get exposed to the culture(s) of the language you are learning.####$$##%NEGATIVE

@Caitlin, I don't work for Rosetta Stone, but have been a customer. I know preachers that don't have much money and they think like I do, worth every penny. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you to those that gave me information,I just looked up the requirements for operating systems,I think I'm a windows 7 and it's compatable with it,I'm pleasently suprised with the extensive amount of operating systems that it works for.####$$##%POSITIVE
wonderful story####$$##%POSITIVE
Great, thank you, just ordered complete set of irish, hopefully i'll be able to help my kids in school now!!!! Wish me luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
just wish it wasnt so expensive so icould learn spanish and italian...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I want to learn Spanish because my husband is Hispanic but this program is just so expensive####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree Jessica! I really would like to get the spanish lessons to supplement what my kids are taught at school, plus I would like to learn it myself! Just can't afford it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got Rosetta Stone German on April 1st of this year.  RS has really helped me improve my spoken German and my comprehension.  I had 8 university classes in German, and was afraid to speak and really could not understand as much as I wanted.  I am in Level 5 now, but have slowed down as I am back in the German program at the university.  When I opened the book for this semester, I was surprised to see that I knew most of the vocabulary from RS! Also, I have been speaking, via SKYPE,with people in Germany and understand so much more! The studios are essential in learning how to speak and understand. I posted in the discussion section about a month ago:     http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=85439812053&topic=15342####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys! I appreciate the responses and the links!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, I suppose it's semantics or maybe I have high standards.  Make no mistake though, you get your moneys worth from RS.  What you learn for the money and the time is far beyond any other method I've used.   I also think that RS leaves you well positioned for a higher level.  I wonder if there are formal descriptions of these terms somewhere?####$$##%POSITIVE
I am studying Japanese through RS. I like it so far but I'm still in the beginning parts. My mother is also using it and she's doing pretty good.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have Rosetta Stone Mandarin for 4 monthes and didn't learn anything.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have heard that french is alot easier but spanish is waaaay more useful and interesting! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Alex! I'll be in touch after the long weekend (Just Kimmy. There's no "berly" ;-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I find watching foreign speaking movies to be a bit of a challenge but, like anything, thoe more you immerse yourself, the easier it becomes.####$$##%POSITIVE
Those little orange sections are yummy!####$$##%POSITIVE
Totally agree!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Japanese and I'm an Otaku (fan on anime). Watching anime and J-Dramas with subtitles helps me recall the meaning of words faster while boosting my vocabulary.####$$##%POSITIVE
Watch Spanish movies when a get a chance, definitely outta practice, TRY watching movies you've watched dozens of times in English.  Then you know what's going on enough to fill in the gaps because Native Speakers are FAST!####$$##%POSITIVE
I watch movies and play games in Japanese.  Algamor: Almost every DVD has the option of watching it in Spanish. There aren't many with the language I'm learning.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Excellent! One down. TY! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
will speak moron.####$$##%NEGATIVE
AWESOME! Thank you so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
spanish####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I print them out and put them in a binder.  SOmeone suggested that, and it really works!  I put notes in there, and also have a laminated grammar review in the binder pockets.####$$##%POSITIVE
Where is the course content located. That sounds great####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I just recently started printing them out.  After I've done a unit, I print it out and go over them, highlighter in hand.  Really helps me understand the grammer.####$$##%POSITIVE
James, great suggestion.  I print these out too :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Janice K thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the info. I will register for a studio session and visit the support site####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. Fear not. It will come. Repetition is the key. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Exactly how I feel when I'm on this page.####$$##%POSITIVE
English one. i'm about to reach the third level ; & i need some practice :)####$$##%POSITIVE
yea me too i love learning rosetta stone?####$$##%POSITIVE

Thank You for your help  Geoffrey!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your help and fast response!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! (:####$$##%POSITIVE
I already did! I just finished unit 1 (:####$$##%POSITIVE
French and Italian. So happy I can speak them..next maybe Japanese or German or Chinese..who knows! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
verrry good for learning english. for every one.####$$##%POSITIVE
Speaking with Afghans is really different because of all the micro-cultures so everywhere we went had a different dialect.Words were longer or shorter,pronounced differently...ect.Just adapting to that was rough!####$$##%POSITIVE
But for the most part it was extremely easy after all the RS classes!####$$##%POSITIVE
Destination? That would be living in Brazil or Portugal, with a job there, and a native girlfriend. Can RS help me with that? *grinning*####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!  Just went through lesson one.  Many more fun hours to go!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much for your help Tracie!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Tracie. However I'm a Scottish guy living in Malta and I think that the number you have provided is an American number right??####$$##%POSITIVE
Portuguese  for sure !!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Polish :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am half way through level 1. :)  Will I be able to have a conversation when I finish all 5 levels?  I know I will need to practice with a native speaker of Spanish ofcourse.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank You very much for the answer! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm liking this....####$$##%POSITIVE
Thx you for everything. I will talk to her about it. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I learnt a few new words, but more so, it mad me realise that I have taken in and learnt a lot and was able to communicate with him and understand most things!####$$##%POSITIVE
That's awesome! I am learning Manadrian right now then either Arabic or Farsi is next!####$$##%POSITIVE
Lo necesitaras tu animal!! I'm bilingual going for trilingual... Learning italian since it sounds. similar to spanish.. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Japanese should have levels 1-5 instead of 1-3 ;)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree...I want to learn Spanish, but I can't aford Rosetta Stone. :o(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I want to learn several but its a little to expensive for single moms####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes it does work, for every language.  The course, how it works and functions is the same for every language.  You can completely assume that what people say about their experiences is the same for Irish or any other language.  The only difference in these course is the language itself. The words you learn are for the same concepts and ideas and in the same order for all languages.  Also, if you buy it from RS direct or one of their shopping mall kiosks, you have six months to find out for yourself and to return it, no questions asked if you are not satisfied.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the irish package!! it's absolutely amazing. if you want to know more about it message me####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you (not that you).  I can't type :)  Thank you again :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It's really great and the Coaches are helpful and adjust to your needs.   If you have completed a unit, you are ready and you really should try it out.####$$##%POSITIVE
The studio sessions are great.  I wish I had tried them sooner, it was super helpful.  I now try to set them up twice a week to improve my conversation skills.  I am learning Farsi so all my sessions have been one on one since there are few people learning this language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you everyone for the information :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait to finish Level 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've finished all levels 1 to 5 in French and haven't received anything. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I didnt get a certificate after level three.  When did you start sending certificates?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I didn't get one for Level 3, but I got one for Level 5 several weeks after I completed it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool!.....will I get one then soon??? ####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome! Thanks for the clarification.####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay, thank you for the info :)  I have a lot of friends that like Hebrew studies too.  I will recommend this product.####$$##%POSITIVE
Shared the info on my FB wall.  Thanks again. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, thank you Geoffrey.  I want to learn both :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay, thank you Janice.  That is good news. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely. The point of having studio is to allow you the opportunity to overcome that...!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, don't think of Studio as a test because it isn't.   It's a way of trying out what you learned.  Try it again, it's "all you can eat" for the period of your subscription.####$$##%POSITIVE
Scottish is my heritage... I'm in Canada, so we don't have barns and noble... i'll try chapters or coles... but i've never heard of a better program than rosetta stone... i've sent requests for Scottish Gaelic several times over several years now, and still nothing... it's disappointing####$$##%NEGATIVE
yea, it's an idea, but if I'm going to spend the money, I'd much rather it actually be for the language I want, instead of something close to it...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Studios are great! I am at level 5 of German, and have had many coaches.  All have a great personality and a sense of humor - especially as you can form more sentences and express more ideas!####$$##%POSITIVE
yes! i cant wait for my next one! it was great when i said i had red and black hair. everyone laughed and the whole thing just made me feel extremely comfortable! i cant wait till i'm on level 5! :D i bet its amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
It is really great - although I have had to cancel the last few studios because more pressing commitments have come up.  I look forward to continuing with units 3 & 4 in Level 5!####$$##%POSITIVE
no drake said " I CAN TEACH YOU MY LANGUAGE "ROSETTA STONE" thats what he said####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Sarah for your help. Issue resolved :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish , Hebrew , Chinese and Urdu are my future interest , Rosetta is too expensive !!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta is probably THE most cost effective way to learn a language! Its way cheaper, faster, and more effective than college courses. And I dont know of any other way besides moving somewhere that speaks the language you want to learn that will actually help you. Und T.K., lustig, weil meine Großmutter komme aus Deutschland. Sie ist meine einzige Großelter übrig. Und liebe ich mit sie zu reden. Nützlich, weil ich auch Spanisch spreche. Aber viele leute Spanisch konnen. Weniger konnen Deutsch, also nach ich se hr gut werde, dann sehe ich aus stärker für die Arbeit.####$$##%POSITIVE
Why is it you don't answer the question with the actual number....i already bought the 5 levels & i plan to buy 2 more languages. Answer the question accurately don't make me count YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE NUMBER, IT IS PERFECTLY  LEGITIMATE QUESTION! This lack of transparency make me doubt you for the first time as I ask in the webinars, costumer service & FB and nobody answer the question....i am frustrated & disapointed!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
We are not speaking, we are writing.  I am a traditionalist. Context is also important.  This is not about prestige but relevance and perhaps emotional energy or the lack of it.   Had he used a similar orthography for a more elaborate expression of his life experience I might be fascinated.  As it is, my cat is more expressive.####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome bc i would just rather wait till 5 comes out in order to buy them haha =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I write all new words and sometimes sentences from core lessons too, it helps me remember and understand more)))####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Nan.  I kind of feared hearing that I should learn Russian cursive, but hey...if it was easy, then everyone would do it.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank u####$$##%POSITIVE
i tryed it and learned some new words thank u so much that was a lot of help####$$##%POSITIVE
Your chances are pretty goo! What level Spanish?####$$##%POSITIVE
The only problem that I see is that you will be ahead of the other students and may get bored in the college class! It is a great confidence booster!####$$##%POSITIVE
No wonder i like learning other languages so i can impress women one day. es la verdad####$$##%POSITIVE
All those languages and all ya get is   hmmmm, yep, no!! Funny!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks! I will wait a little to 'flip it on'.####$$##%POSITIVE
OK. Thx for heads up.####$$##%POSITIVE
english!! I always hope that I want to speak english well..T 0T####$$##%POSITIVE
hehe :)I'm going to study hard!! thank you for your encouragement, ashleigh!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
If you English is this good already then you will have no problem with Rosetta Stone!  Nice job!  Congratulations!####$$##%POSITIVE
With people like you out there, I think there may be hope for me!  Thanks...I actually thought I was paying close attention, but I didn't notice the vowel/consonant thing!!  I was so focused on masculine, feminine, plural, etc.  They say it's good to exercise the ole brain, and I can honestly say that I am doing just that!  Gracie, lei, voi, tu....####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't know. Thanks for the advice.####$$##%POSITIVE
wish i had the money.... boooooo..... :/####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't wait to teach my little niece some japanese!####$$##%POSITIVE
I studied French in school and it was my worst subject.   Now I've learned Arabic and relearned French with RS.  However, we are all individuals.  If you buy it directly from them (not a bookstore) then you can return it no questions asked within six months.  Try it and see how it works for you.  That's plenty of time to find out.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you, wow in only a few minutes it was starting to click with that demo. Once I get enough money will definitely purchase lvl 1 Spanish thanks:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Meredith, before I started using Rosetta Stone, I failed my spanish class.  Now, I have been told I speak Spanish without an American accent!  If you can, I'd recommend you purchase all five levels; you'll find it will be worth it and Rosetta Stone has payment plans as well.  Good luck either way!####$$##%POSITIVE
im so glad you have payment plans! that is so awesome I am definitely going to get all 5 levels!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok. Thanks you two!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone Italian is awesome. It totally stimulates your natural language learning skills and has opened worlds for me. I am in love with it.####$$##%POSITIVE
No just levels 1 to 3, which is annoying because I'm thinking about learning Portuguese after French, and not having the full course puts me off a bit!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not having all of the levels puts me off too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I saw the contest thing, I was thinking of doing it for awhile, and I actually have ordered the Spanish cuz I liked the demo so much.####$$##%POSITIVE
I will! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the iPhone app in the UK????####$$##%NEGATIVE
A corporation is only as good as its worst employee. After frustrating hours on the phone with several Rosetta Stone employees and no resolution I and my daughter in law are more than offended. We feel conned and cheated. I will be more than happy to remove my post after a resolution has been reached.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Customer service has been reached several times.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Sarah!####$$##%POSITIVE
I pretty much guarantee Andrew had a head start on you; he's been studying Arabic for years. In any of the competitive games I play with him, he destroys me...but it helps you grow.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hiya Sarah...haven't heard anything yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Christy, i did submit a ticket but did not get any reply.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks, I am kinda getting frustrated cause the program asks me questions on stuff i havent covered yet so of course i get it wrong, then the next lesson it covers the word in question do i have this thing installed wrong or something?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Simy, it was a very good session, thank you :-) Hasta pronto :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christy, thank you for your instructiions. I will come back to you if the situation does not improve after the changes you suggested. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Now I'm curious. If I were an American expat living in Russia, South Korea, Japan, China or an Arabic-speaking country and I typed www.rosettastone.com into my browser, would I be automatically and irreversibly redirected to a site that is not only not in English but that uses a character set I can't read?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Christy, I've done the changes and unfortunately it is still freezing. Is there any way to go back and uninstall the updates? Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Christy, I choose the chat option. One of your colleugue assisted me and partely solved the problem. It is much better now with only occasional freezes. Thank you for your quick answers and assistance. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's great, thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just purchased!####$$##%POSITIVE
I thought so, too, but it's really not that bad. I was actually surprised that there were people more confused than I was! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been using French 1-5, sometimes get "brain freeze" at a particular Unit. The advange to Rosetta is that it is very engaging, interactive, and can be addicting. Compared to filling out boring workbooks or struggling in a class, this approach with the games, studios, voice recognition, etc. makes me forward to working with it. And if you do get stuck the customer success team offers sugggestions.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm sure that you will do better! When I took my first studio, I couldn't remember anything.  When I took it over, I felt more confidence and didn't make the same mistakes.  Are you just starting Italian? I just had my level 1 Unit 2 Italian studio 1/2 an hour ago.####$$##%POSITIVE
Nanakat, I've had audio problems before and I have clicked on Live Help so that tech support will be notified and attempt to fix the problem.  Also I have typed (in English) to the coach via the chat option to let her know of any problems.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Janice - I am just starting Italian and want to do Unit One Studio again, but I cannot figure out how to go back to it now that I have begun Unit 2!! Heidi--great advice! I will look for those options if I ever run into problems again! Thank you both!####$$##%POSITIVE
NanaKat it helps to do the studio sessions a few times, if you go back to Unit 1, below the Milestone you should see the "schedule" icon. Senza paura! ####$$##%POSITIVE
If it works so well, then why is it so expensive to purchase this product?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Because it works. Duhh####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rebecca and Ashleigh! I will be going over the unit and scheduling another session! I am looking forward to the opportunity to redeeming myself!  You folks are very encouraging...thank you so much. Ciao!####$$##%POSITIVE
Tom Adams answered that:  Rosetta Stone competes with real world language classes (including live tutoring) which cost a lot more than Rosetta Stone.  You can also use Rosetta Stone at your own pace, which adds to the value of the product considerably over having to find time to go to classes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ican't send the link wasn't a link####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just purchased portuguese and spanish and thats great to hear all the positive comments. I'm so excited to start. I bought Rosetta Stone because everyone speaks so highly of the programs.  I look forward to my program arriving in the mail. Can't wait to start!!! lol :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Why it cost so much?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Look above. It works####$$##%POSITIVE
Aww, no mention that Allen really wanted to learn Russian and couldn't find a program to do that at the time...and hence The Rosetta Stone was born.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow 5 comments####$$##%POSITIVE
I like Rosetta Stone, sometimes If you want the best, then you have to pay a little more, I brought the spanish (spain) so when its time for me to go back to school, I will be a step ahead of everyone, my next language is portuguese, once I get the spanish down, learning portuguese will be a little simple.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been a fan of Rosetta Stone since I first used it as part of my class' language lab (in 2001, v3); also, at every oppty that I get, I plug RS, because it is a great product. It is expensive, but it is a terrific investment that allows its users to reap the rewards. So..., not a question, just a comment! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice work on the video! : )####$$##%POSITIVE
Charles from the Harrisonburg, VA Tech Support just fixed my problem.  He was great!  Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
With all the international job markets around the world, I believe that a foreign language is probably the best weapon anyone could have.####$$##%POSITIVE
i love japanese...Konnichiwa, ogenki des ka. Watashi wa namae wa debiddoudes####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome! Thanks:)####$$##%POSITIVE
It is happening to me also, but with some exercises. Also I look those exercises and internally they are made all ready, but the program doesn't check them... :S. Also, is taking too long to return home. And that happends with the last up date.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's come back now but it takes a lot longer to load up and return home. Very annoying!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Right.....if I log off and back on again, it shows my progress and returns unit 4 of all levels 1-5.  It just doesn't seem to like it when I go back or explore other lessons that were not included in the 'recommended' course.  I liked going back and doing the lessons it misses by going to the 'explore all activities' section and doing the 8 lessons then, as a recap once I've finished the milestone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Liam, I had a similar problem and tech support was a big help####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ashleigh, I am aware of the live coach.  I've done that before.  But what if you have questions on grammar?  The coach is just speaking Spanish and I can't ask my questions in Spanish.  It's easier to get a English explanation why some things are.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was fun.  I went through it several times until I could get it right only because I know if I do not understand all of it, I will not understand much of it as I move along.  I am enjoying the lessons.  I did have a major technical difficulity in the beginning that took too long to resolve (a week) and lost time, so that had a lot to do with having to review over again.####$$##%POSITIVE
No. I hate that southern-born word. Odio esa palabra, les hace ver muy estupido. Odio quella parola, è una vergogna alla lingua. その単語を大嫌いくても削除する方がいい。####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats true Janice, thts why I didnt buy it the first time, It is cheaper than going to school for it. and I want to get the portuguese RS and either German or French.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS is very inexpensive if you compare the quality with other learning venues.  If you have TotalE and use the Studio Sessions regularly you will probably have more speaking opportunities than you would in a college class (you can avail yourself of a Studio Session as frequently as you want).  I have studied various languages using different methods for years.  RS is by far the best unless you are able to do an immersion program in the country where the language is spoken.####$$##%POSITIVE
....I can not speak for the other languages offered by Rosetta Stone. I study Swedish. The Swedish tutors are more than a bargain at the price. I spend about nine hours a week in tutoring so that is 36 hours a month. I pay $129 shipped per disk... which includes headphones and three months of tutoring. USB headphones cost $35 in my area. $129 - $35 = $94. 36 hours a month x 3= 108 hours. $94/108 hrs = .870or $.87 per tutor hour. I am not even addressing the cost of the material on the disk.  When I complete Rosetta Stone (there are three levels of Swedish), I will have to pay either $1600 for forty lessons at a language institute or fifty dollars per lesson hour with other Swedish tutors. This is why I spend thirty six hours a month and have amassed 1,050 note cards in a six month period. Thirty six hours a month at fifty dollars an hour is $1800.   The tutors must be willing to go beyond the basic materials presented once the student has mastered the concepts. I will continue tutoring for an additional month once completion of the program. I want to amass as much of the langauge before I must pay these higher costs.####$$##%POSITIVE
yea but they dont offer the language i need to learn! i need to learn albanian! they dont have it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Marcia.we're proud of you....i want tı learn spanish too..good for you :)))####$$##%POSITIVE
i used this method at home to learn english and since I came here from mexico after hers work I cash now speak english well thank you rosetta stone####$$##%POSITIVE
It's so amazing to hear succesful stories from learners. Keep up the great work, Marcia!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wanna become fluent in Spanish as well i can understand it midly but i cant speak that well...:(  i can type it pretty well ....####$$##%POSITIVE
I had this problem, too.  Make sure Rosetta Stone is closed on your computer when you use the Mobile Companion. That worked for me. :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
okay thank u.####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, Donald, for some strange reason I found the very first milestone - level 1 unti 1 - to be the hardest out of all the ones I have done so far (through level 2, unit 2).  I could never remember what they wanted from me!  So, I bet you will find these get easier for you as well, as you go along.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much Dougie!!! I've sent you the message with my mail ok! thank you again...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks JK!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nothing at all ,thank you ...I've improved my English and still learning German, not just empty words you are No.1 Learning program ...####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you sir.####$$##%POSITIVE
The Polish language like any Slavic language is difficult. I am Mexican and speak Spanish so I was not familiar with the sounds at all. I did start from  level 1 and it was very easy to follow. The program was great and since you're familiar with Russian it shouldn't be ad daunting for you as it was me.  I also bought Polish Verbs and Essentials of Grammar by Oscar Swan and it is a great guide.####$$##%POSITIVE
I find in most studio sessions the instructors will include some vocab that either you haven't got to in the course yet, or the course doesn't cover. Sometimes the other students have been studying using other recourses (which is a good idea once you become more confident in the language), so that's how they know some vocab that isn't covered. Sometimes learners repeat older sessions, so they know more vocab as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
I recommend a small book called "The Arabic Alphabet."  I've been through that book twice, but being able to read Arabic in RS fast enough that I could play Buzz Bingo still escaped me. OTOH, RS really helped me feel more comfortable with the positional forms of the Arabic letters.####$$##%POSITIVE
At some point it is useful to learn the written form when you are studying a language with a non-roman alphabet, but there are so many quick resources for that, either on the web or in libraries.  Having studied two such languages, I'd recommend putting off writing until I was used to readling a little.  RS introduces letters quite well, at least in Arabic and Russian and I've found that knowing a little of the language before worrying about the formal alphabet made it easier to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok great! Thanks everyone there is a lot to think about.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.  will ck it out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the help, have a nice day.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, thank you so much! I appreciate it ! My account will going to due in coming february, I hope I could downloading into my iPhone ####$$##%POSITIVE
@ James -- DUH -- I need to pay attention!!!  Thanks!  Once completed, what would be the next advancement?####$$##%POSITIVE
shade I'm learning italian with the online version. I'm on level 3 and I can have conversations w native speakers, read short stories and listen to italian songs on my iPod. however at times I refer to a dictionary for a specific word, or verb tense but that is all part of the learning process. I don't think there's a language course out there that will make you fluent in 3-6 months, RS does not make you fluent but it gives you the skills to be "functional" in a conversation. it has taken me 4 months to do 3 levels and I do at least an hour a day, not counting studio time. ####$$##%POSITIVE
@Rosetta Stone.  Thank you.  In your opinion, how long will it take (conservative estimate) to complete 5 levels?  I can devote 2 hrs per day.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rebecca thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes i learned english with rosetta stone. Thanks i love your software. I can speak english , arabic , farsi. :-) and some turkish####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am going to check this out myself as I keep having headset issues as well... already tried all 3 USB ports.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It may seem expensive but you get what you pay for.  I'm completely happy with my purchase and consider it money well spent.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ditto, Wil. Worth every penny. Not to mention the attentive and dedicate RS staff. I love my RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay I guess I'll consider :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Roxanne, if you have the money, and want to learn a language, RS is worth the purchase. I've tried many different language learning programs and studied 8 different languages. Nothing compares to RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
They don't have a lot of languages.  It costs them a lot to produce a language and takes a lot of time.  If there is demand for a course then they will offer it.  What they offer represents market demand from Business, Government and private individuals.####$$##%POSITIVE
I cant because Rosetta stone discriminates Welsh language but not Scottish Gaelic####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's always about the money isn't it. Makes sense I guess....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the suggestion, but the programs were running.  Guess I need to call customer service again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I played around with it a bit more and got it working.  Thanks for your help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
That was a really interesting article. I'm thinking Russian next? :)####$$##%POSITIVE
This gives me confidence in my German learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
Really good article.####$$##%POSITIVE
William you are a life saver.  Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I say both. The classroom helps me with reading and writing. And RS helps me in listening and speaking. I never tried both at the same time but I will though.####$$##%POSITIVE
For me when I took spanish in college, it helped me speak and write a whole lot better, the RS helps me read, but RS doesnt really tell you when to use certain words for example like tu, a, ellas,ellos, su, son. and what words to put at the end of the words, I am taking spanish, what language are you taking.####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely learning it with RS.  I think it is the very best way to get started in terms of less time, less cost and less stress.  I do think it has limits and at a certain point you need some exposure to the literature of the language and some of its technical grammar. Then a classroom or, a third possibility you didn't mention, self study.   These are much easier after taking the RS course.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am on level 3, I am getting some of it, but I will have to go back to unit 2 to refresh some of it, thats the good think about RS, you can go back and redo the lesson as much as you want.####$$##%POSITIVE
Going to the country....best way and gateau. RS good second place if they would fix their subscription policy to reflect the value of the purchase. I have 3 courses, the all use the same medusa pictorially. Just the words change.thr iPad app syltor be Self container requiring no Network connection####$$##%NEGATIVE
In two levels of RS Spanish, I have learned/retained way more than I learned in four years of high school french and 1 year of college french.  So, I guess you have my answer.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have trouble retaining, if I even go a day without doing the RS, I forget, but its a good thing I can go back over it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald, if you keep using the Review feature in RS, you will find in time that it sticks.  The coaching sessions also help.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Rosetta Stone!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nah disagree. I paid for the course through the purchase of the product. And no, it does not keep up with my computer course..always starts from it's own level. As foe a language lab...that is free in my state, anyone can can use it, but WHO a has the time. the iPad app should be self contained with all media, so one can use it anywhere, including on a plane. Too expensive to not have this feature.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Read the license ... you agreed to what I described when you opened the box.  You may want something else but you agreed to those terms.   The Language lab in your state is free to you but someone is paying for it. It costs money to somebody and someone was paid for the equipment and someone is paid to run it.  So riddle me this, if it is all that you require - what motivates RS to write the iPad app at all if they get no revenue for it?  Why should they write it at all?  Software with less capability than what they now provide cost even more in earlier versions.   Less expensive software does exist but it actually is not as good.    In your desires, you fail to recognize that someone is paying for what you want.####$$##%POSITIVE
I suspect the ipad app will get better, Debbie.  I like it to, and wish it had more, but it is just the first offering from RS.  Right now, it is a little buggy - sometimes it syncs, sometimes not; sometimes it crashes, etc., - and my guess is RS is working to stabilize it better before adding more to it.  Patience is probably the key.  I don't feel cheated just when RS is  adding to what I bought (which was the cd course to use on my computer).   I just enjoy whatever new things come along.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sorry Geoffrey, just do not buy the justification. I am in the computer industry. Networking is not the price tag you attempt to justify, plus he product should be stand alone on a iPad, especially since there is no tacking reliability withe the computer version, (bad logic to think eveyone who uses the computer will be online) and there s no further expansion features, only the basic app..thus it should be free forever. Remember I own my win company and work in this industry. My clients would not tolerate fees for a product the purchase and we do norpt charge that. Single price, forever use. Even so, the iPad version should be stand alone, no network required.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's kind of good to know this.  I don't have a iPad yet but I'm getting one. I hope it gets better. Paying extra would annoy me too.  I only have one langauge with RS so far but I hope to do many more.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have a degree in Chinese, and I can say with certainty that some of the material I'm seeing in Level 4 was not covered in 4 years of University. The same university that ultimately produced Dashan. I wish all 5 levels in V4 existed then...####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm so happy that they have all 5 levels now (^_^)####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait to order all five levels.####$$##%POSITIVE
The studios are a wonderful way to determine your progress.  I am in level 5 of German, but will have my first studios in Italian next week, so I understand your Angst!####$$##%POSITIVE
The glitch automatically resets the internal microphone settings to maximum settings.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Christy, thank you for the phone number, would that they didn't drop my call twice. I could have completed two lessons in the time spent on hold between hangups.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That may be the case that you've chosen not to use the internal mics built in to the hardware of most portable pcs, however the same hardware permits voip communication that crosses oceans without echo. It has been possible to gerrymander settings that allow for the use of internal mics, however the glitch seems to be the override of these settings. I have version 3, that version 4 doesn't address this seems like an oversight.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It may be the case that a boom mic registers best acoustically, but from a user experience standpoint not having access to an option that permits use of internal mics seems like an error. It is true that you can use an internal mic to do the vocal portions, however the presets that the program imposes make for a poor experience with continuous monitoring required. That is the point I was trying to address and get answers for.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Gregory for explaining engineering limitations of the program. I'm sure the problems I am having are of my own creation. Forgive my ignorance on these matters. Forgive my thinking that a program that requires a microphone might be able to use the one built in to a computer. Forgive my expectation that there might be a way to utilize that hardware and adjust settings within the software to make the best of a lesser option. I'm just a user with a problem trying to use a software program with problems. Thank you for telling me that it wont work. Debbie, since you have found away to make it work, would you mind sharing your technique for laptop settings?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE

Tried to connect with 6 or 7 different players - all seemed to accept the game, it started loading the screen where the game would show and then it stalled.  Within 30 seconds to a minute after the stall the error message popped up.  Odd that it was with EVERY player, isn't it?  Was there a general server problem at RS last night from 8-9pm eastern?####$$##%NEGATIVE
don't see an email from you Alex - in either my RS registered email or the account I use for FB - can you message me on FB so  that we can chat?  I've never successfully connected with someone through the online games so I was surprised last night when there was actually someone to play with that I still couldn't connect.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just got the emailed and have replied - thanks Alex.####$$##%POSITIVE
It does NOT recognize when you do speaak correctly, cannot correct you, There is NO dicyionary, How are you suppose to understand something, if you DO NOT KNOW what you are doing?!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
My program recognizes when I say the words correctly.  Also, as far as a dictionary, I have dictionaries.  If I REALLY do not understand something, I will look up the word, but I have found that the program has helped me retain words and ideas far beyond simple translation.  After college classes that were merely translation and grammar drills, I LOVE the fact that I can figure out a meaning, and speak with a native speaker at the level that I can.  It is unfortunate that the program didn't work for you - there are other options and I hope that you have found one that works for you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Are you friggen kidding????? Come on now, Get real! If you do not know what something is, please tell me, HOW are you going to retain it? How can you LOVE figuring out what you DO NOT KNOW???? huh????? What other options does Rosetta Stone, do for someone who spent $800 dollars on what? I was told I had to pay even more money to ALLOW a native speaker to speak with me? What did I purchase this crappy Rosetta Stone for? Please let me know of 1 person who has successlly learned another language and is using it! I have yet to have met 1 person, and I have been asking around! Maybe I can start a "NEW" business, Those who have truly learned a language, Please Speak UP!!!!!  I have had the pleasure to surround myself with native speakers, who also feel that ROSETTA STONE, was designed not by someone who knows languages! I happen to speak 4 languages, none through Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Suzanne, in six months time, I am speaking at conversational level. I study Swedish. During my trip three weeks ago, I spoke English only three times to the natives in southern Sweden; once was due to a Swede who saw my USA address and refused to speak in Swedish further.  Rosetta Stone teaches  a mild northern accent where southern Swedes speak with a very thick germanic accent at fluency level.  To master any language, it takes a lot of study, practice and hard work. I've amassed 1,075 index cards after my lesson last hour. The lessons alone will not get anyone near conversational or fluency level. The above happened due to the tutors and that is the value I find with Rosetta Stone. The Swedish software is good outside of the grammar but I am where I am today because the Swedish staff goes far beyond the basics presented within the learning material. I did the math last night and discovered I pay $.87 per tutor lesson hour. The tutor waiting for me when I finish with Rosetta Stone charges $50 for the same hour.   Each persons experience is different but to me, this is a no brainer if the staff is willing to really teach the language, not walk through the lessons without further education.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Suzanne....I don't think you understand the process of how RS stone actually works. And remember, if it didn't, I'm sure they would be bust by now with everybody claiming their refunds after 6 months.####$$##%POSITIVE
Suzanne, I have learned a language I knew nothing at all about using Rosetta Stone.   I re-learned and improved another one that I had not used for a very long time.   Despite your "are you frikkin kiddig", have you stopped to consider how babies learn?  Do they use dictionaries or grammar books?  People have for centuries learned languages simply because they found themselves amongst people who spoke it.  RS is based on well established psychology that has been proven more effective, namely immersion in the language.   To answer your question, the way you learn what a word or sentence means, you look at the picture, you think about what is happening in that picture just a baby would learn when you point at something and say something about it.   It works, it has worked for many people.   My suggestion is that instead of raging against it, saying something that people who have tried it, know you to be false ... do what the rest of us have done and simply use the product as directed.  If you give it a chance, you will be amazed at how much you will learn. We all have been there, we like to help one another but I don't appreciate your raging or use of references to curse words.  This is not how you learn anything.  If you behaved as you have here in a class room environment, you would be kicked out.  So settle down and you will learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have become conversationally fluent, yes, with RS's help.  If you purchased RS less than 6 months ago from them, then you can return it.  I believe that it is as close to actual immersion as you can get.  If you were suddenly in a country with a foreign language, it would be the same and you would HAVE to learn - not just complain.  I speak German over SKYPE and to natives now with more confidence because I understand the concepts - not just the words.  I am NOT FRIGGIN' KIDDING YOU.  Maybe, this is not the program for you.  You may need to just go to the country of the language that you wish to speak and learn there.####$$##%POSITIVE
Suzanne you claim "it does not recognize when you speak correctly".   This is not true when it is set up using the Microphone / headset combo that comes with it.  If you are using a micropphone that is not a "Boom Mic" and part of your headset then what you say would be true but then you are not using it as the instructions say that you should.####$$##%POSITIVE
Geoffrey, I have experienced  the sofware not recognizing when I've said wrong words as well. Most state side USB headsets work with the software. I've had enough broken to know lol.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have wanted to purchase RS Italian 1-5 for quite some time.  Yesterday I took the plunge because of free shipping, $50 discount and the five part payment plan....can't wait for it to arrive!  My three year old grandson is learning Italian from his Nonna....hope I can keep up with him!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Barb, you will love the Italian 1-5. I have it and have been progressing through it as opportunity arises. It is definately worth every penny.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm on level 4 of Rosetta Stone Spanish.  Not only can I understand other people, but when I speak Spanish just about all of the Latinos I've talked with have told me my accent is excellent.  Give it time and effort.  More so than you might think.  But if you do, it does work.  The voice recognition can be a little faulty at times; I'd say it recognizes about 95% of the errors I  make, but voice recognition is an incredibly difficult technology; since the '80s when it was first introduced, to today.  Most people have no idea how much goes into voice recognition, either; especially if the company builds it's own speech models, which, Rosetta Stone does.  Like I said, give it time. Begin at the very beginning and over time, you'll train your mouth how to speak correctly.####$$##%POSITIVE
that doesn't answer my question though####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok thank you ####$$##%POSITIVE
i've been using it for German...i'm taking German classes too...it's a great supplement to the class####$$##%POSITIVE

I have Irish 1-3, and Russian 1-5. Now I want Spanish 1-5. I'm a happy language-nerd. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the encouragement. I was wondering what kinda speed should I go through these lessons at, currently I have been doing 2-3 hours a day. Is the program meant for 1 lesson per day, or can I power through allot of them and still have the same effectiveness? So far I am retaining everything I have learnt, but down the road will this still be the case or is it recomended that I slow down?####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Liam, thanks very much for your feedback.  I am lucky to work at a university with a language centre with lots of magazines, videos, and a 'buddy' system so i could get a German-speaking buddy who wants to improve their English.  Plus half of my research group are German, which helps!  Just having to reconsider now as they cheekily didnt add VAT on until the end of my order, so its £50 more expensive than i had anticipated!####$$##%POSITIVE
I know. It isn't cheap but I do think it's worth it and would always recommend it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am about to enter the 5th level of German, and I love it!!!  I can say whatever I want and however I want.  By the end of level 4 I am already conversationally fluent and cannot wait to continue to level 5!####$$##%POSITIVE
At the top of the left side under "level one". However I have noticed there are times when I jump back and forth a lot that my program gets confused and I have to reboot my computer. Every time I finish a review of a level I have already completed it goes back to the furthest level page (level 3). I think it's got a glitch because it really doesn't like me doing reviews on my own. It insists I must complete my writing lesson which I am trying desperately to ignore!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It did take me a while to find that little button, as the programme was acting a bit glitchy --yes it is hard to move around sometimes.  And when I clicked the milestone and would speak into it , it was so very very slow that I gave up 1/2 way into it so my computer was obviously not interacting well with that programme last night.   I will try again later.  thanks for the help everyone--its frustrating when you just want to get something done and you get road blocked.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My mic worked on Lesson One. The next day, it would not work during Lesson Two. Grr!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Christy, Please refer to case Reference #14006-1909615, #14006-1913884, #14006-1913895, and #14006-1913884. All the diagnostics you suggest have been tried and proven to be correct. I guess I should clarify my problem, I originally installed V4.0.12 and was updating as prompted by the software, and everything worked fine. Then I updated to V4.1.15 and the software stopped recognizing any sound when I am in the lessons. The microphone and headphone speakers work fine with other windows applications. During RS microphone setup, the green bar graph still indicates that sounds are being monitored. Given some of the other things I have read on the internet about the Rosetta Stone Company, I rather like the idea of working through this issue publicly on fb.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Budget cutting? Not a good idea, in this case. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh no.  Hope that's not the case.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ahhhhhhh me too!!!! I started off with Spanish from Spain, but I can't stand the accent, "manzana" is said like "manthana" so now I have Spanish Latin American - and I just installed Portuguese too!! I am so excited I can't wait!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have just had to let go when it comes to subjunctive and figure it will all work out in time. I'm starting level 5 now and there is more subjunctive but it's making more sense now. I do each studio session about 3 times. Listening to the audio CD has really helped me. I listen in the car every time I drive for 15 minutes or more. Today I played one lesson over about 3 or 4 times before I had it, but that's okay. The review and pronunciation practice in the audio CD's help so much.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you everyone for the words of wisdom and encouragement. I just had quite a string of adaptive recall that really helped. I think that I will definitely back up a bit for some timely review.####$$##%POSITIVE
Glad to hear you are back at it.  I hardly ever get the adaptive recall prompt.  I wish I did.  I don't know why I don't.####$$##%POSITIVE
If you have the CDs, you are missing the games, the studios, and the stories.  If that doesn't mean anything to you, then you aren't missing anything.  If you never tried them, that is too bad.  You've missed some of the better upgrades.  I paid a lot for the programs (I have multiple), but if it is going to help me, I am glad to sacrifice in order to get the fluency that I need when I go overseas.  I know that not everyone is willing to do that.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is one reason I like the $20/month online version.  It comes with extras for the entire time you have the subscription.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just learned something new from you.  I didn't know the word "desgracia".####$$##%NEGATIVE
Renewing isn't extremely expensive.  If you try to get a private tutor, it will cost more than the $10-$20 a month for the studios, games, stories.  If you haven't tried it, try it for one month to see what you think.####$$##%POSITIVE
You guys are doing a great job!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nancy that was curtesy of my resident puerto rican. He helps me frequently w vocabulary####$$##%POSITIVE
So have you not used them in the time you've had them?  If not, then I guess you won't miss them but I'm dreading when mine go if I don't have the money to renew as I'm loving Studio sessions.####$$##%POSITIVE
I used them but I don't have the money to renew it! Oh well I will just do the CDs ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm learning slowly, but i'm good. The program is excellent!####$$##%POSITIVE

That is very helpful, and just the information for which I was looking. Thank you, Tracie!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks everyone! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@julie - I agree with you and, in fact I think any boom type headset should work.  However, it is simplest to get someone new just back to the included headset first.  Definitely if they are not using a boom type headset they will have problems with the software not recognizing.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE

Oh oh oh - next song... Celos by Fanny Lu.  I used to wander through Mexican grocery stores humming along with it before I understood any of the lyrics.  And now... thanks to Rosetta Stone... I understand them!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I feel like it will be useful someday.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't really understand some of the small words that change based on the number of subjects involved. I'll have to read up on grammar!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Basically, they go over what you learned in the first unit.  I suggest that you take notes because sometimes they give new vocabulary (the coaches can spell it out on the screen).  All of the coaches are encouraging and helpful.  Before the studio, I usually review the unit from the printout of the course (free online from their site), and I use it as a reference during the studio.  Since it is all in the target language, it is all association (remembering the pictures with the words).   Also, you can enter the studio up to 15 minutes before the session. Since this is your first, I suggest that you try and log in early so that you can fix any problems before the session.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree. Not cool. Why did you change it?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you ...####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, you stated that the price point is different.  Rather than $200 for 3 months, it is now $240 for a year.  I just do not want to be at the mercy of my internet provider or feel pressured with the course for a time period (even a year).  Sure, it comes out cheaper overall, but it is not always about price.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Congratulations! I hope you are able to use it towered an amazing vacation!####$$##%POSITIVE

I have been learning Persian/Farsi for about 6 months.  The only thing I have used is Rosetta Stone.  I spend about an hour 4 nights a week working on it.  I have learned so much.  I can do basic conversation which is improving everyday. I even spoke to my boyfriends mother on the phone (in Farsi) over the weekend.  As far as microphones go any headset with a boom microphone works.  I knocked my laptop off the recliner a while back and killed the included microphone and am now using a logitech USB microphone with no problems.  I have noticed that you cannot haven much background noise or it won't recognize it properly.  I have noticed problems with dryer, if i sit near air purifier and things like that but I have never had any problems with a quiet background.    Sometimes I do get frustrated because I don't understand what the program is trying to teach but as I go through the sections I have often have a ah-ha moment of what it is trying to teach.  I every so often see something and the word in Farsi pops into my head.  So give it time and keep going even if you think you don't know what is going on and it will come to you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Congratulations!!! China money?####$$##%POSITIVE
No, American...lol! But eventually it will be converted, lol####$$##%POSITIVE
Agreed Janice.  Yesterday I was playing a video game (not the most important part of my language learning) and I noticed what something said because of my RS lesson.  I am getting better with Japanese due to RS. My only compliant is that it ends at level 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh! I did wonder where she went.  If only she stuck with it.....oh well, you can't please everyone.  We know we are happy with it and the thousands of people who use it are too! Keep up the good work RS! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
My German boyfriend thinks I'm doing very well. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
i speak french pretty damn good thanks to rosetta stone lol so my french friends tell me####$$##%POSITIVE
Its very telling to see the "fan" count on Facebook pages such as this one and other products that all claim to be better.  If I didn't care for the product, I'm not going to be a fan of it! If anything, I'd want my money back, right? So to look at the number of fans RS has is very telling.  Especially since the release of TOTALe where the fan number went from ~12,000 to what it is now.  That tells you a lot about how effective it is.  But, of course you do get your occasional "troll".  I wonder if they work for other language-learning companies and are being paid to spread lies?  I guess we'll never know.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I'm also missing one of the discs. I ordered the program from rosettastonesales.com, is this a legit site? ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hebrew is also only online now.  My mom bought the box of Hebrew that she has wanted for a while.  Not everyone can navigate through the online program.  THe CDs also allow someone who does not have internet access as of yet to still do the course.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ABOVE-RS emphasized that the year access was cheaper than the former 6 month access ($240 now for a year online) and also cheaper than the CDs overall.  Not everyone can learn a language quickly (especially not Japanese or Hebrew) and if you have some major life event, you may not be able to finish in a year, so you have to buy another year.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ALso, Amazon and B&N do not offer the same return policy as RS.  Once the software is open, you can only return it if it is defective.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am not sure what she means by not understanding the pictures?  I know that sometimes I may be "fuzzy" on one of the words but normally later in the lesson it becomes quite clear.  Janice probably can tell you that as an added bonus, learning multiple languages with Rosetta Stone is nice because sometimes if something is not clear in one language, you may remember the picture from another language.  But, then again, I am learning the "easy" languages for speakers of English...Spanish, Portuguese, and of course...Swedish.  PS...I love not having to conjugate verbs...and I love the incredibly simple way of forming other verb tenses...and the best one yet....NO SUBJUNCTIVE!  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm with Geoffrey and Janice.  I find RS to be a great value.  For instance, in the past week I've had 5-6 Studio sessions.  To hire a private or semi-private tutor for 5 hours would easily be $100 or more.####$$##%POSITIVE
Suzanne, I speak French, Chinese, Spanish, and Dutch from Rosetta Stone and am learning Arabic. You mentioned speaking 4 languages, try me in any of them, if ours overlap! French, I'm certified DELF B2, which means I can study at a graduate level. My Chinese is on par with my French. Seriously, I would LOVE to continue this conversation in any language we share other than English.####$$##%POSITIVE
In the UK I got a discount the other day for international languages day, was £80 off so that stopped me trying to decide whether to do it!  I'm loving it, there is no way I could fit in learning a language any other way so it might not be the cheapest but its the only way I can do it####$$##%POSITIVE
@Taylor Jones: I do not speak the languages you learned, otherwise I would challenge you :-) But my personal opinion is, that a level B2 does not make you fluent in any language, even though it qualifies you to apply at a foreign university. I am a level C1 in Italian (also with a certificate, if that means so much to you) but I would still not claim to be "fluent" and/or "speaking" the language. I am very well aware of my shortcomings. Yes I would say you know more than what need to go on a vacation and you would certainly be able to read and also express yourself to a certain extent, but in my opinion  that is still a long way from really "speaking" a language.  Heck, I wouldn't even say I am fluent in English, and I think my English is quite good, as I have lived in New York for three years, worked there and also went to College for a semester.   Maybe it only comes down to how we -as individuals- define "speaking" a language. Maybe my expectations are too high.  But then again I do use English and also Italian on a daily level at work in a business environment (finance and economics) and whereas in English I rarely run into trouble, with Italian I certainly do, and still have to look up words or ask for them to be explained.  RS can NOT teach you that kind of proficiency. But I didn't expect that from RS. So maybe Suzanne had higher expectations, we don't know that.  RS is great for a basic knowledge, but it does not and probably can not teach you the kind of proficiency you need to work in a business environment, because there are just too many fields and it would be too specific to be of interest for most learners.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think its worth it, now about a yr or two ago my latin american spanish program would of cost around $800, but now its $500, I took some spanish in college and I learned more in the 2.5 weeks I had RS than a whole semester in college, I think anything you want to do either if its learning a language or anything you want to do. If it wasnt for the payment plan, I wouldnt of been able to afford it, but I am happy and I think its a good program.####$$##%POSITIVE
I kind of understand what Suzanne means, although I do not appreciate the "tone" in her criticism that seems just purely agressive and she is not really making a point in laying out what it really is, that annoys her so much.  I started learning Italian with Rosetta Stone in 2009 and at times have also been quite frustrated when I would clearly pronounce a word correctly and the program would just not accept it. I knew it was correct because my native-italian Italian teacher told me so. But then I just stopped caring if the program accepted it and relied on the feedback of my teacher.   At times I admit I had no clue what the pictures where trying to tell me, but that of course weren't the easy pictures that show you only one thing. I found some pictures to be a bit challenging in understanding the complex meaning they were trying to convey. But after a while I just let that slip and used the "hinting" feature and then just repeated it.   I also admit that Rosetta Stone has a definite shortcoming making you understand grammar, although I have seen in a later version - when I bought levels 4,5 they seemed to have understood that and are now using color to highlight grammar contents. My earlier levels 1,2,3 didn't have that unfortunately, I think it would have helped me.   Although I realize the shortcomings of the computer program I can say RS DID in fact help me. After studying and finishing the levels 1,2,3 from May - Sept. 2009 I went to Italy for 4 weeks to study at a language school, where I had 6 hours daily, 2 of which were individual lessons with a private teacher. And when I took the entry test I qualified for the B1 level. Although I could not freely and correctly use the language myself I was able to understand a lot more than others in my class.   My personal approach to a language would be using Rosetta Stone for comprehension and vocabulary learning and a teacher for grammar and then visiting a language school in the country.  I have since completed level C1, with the CILS exam with a second 4 weeks vacation doing language school in Florence in 2010 where I prepared myself for the exam which I then took in December 2010.   I am sure everybody has a different approach to a language. Mine is that a combination of RS, books, private lessons and school work best (for me). I honestly do not believe that RS alone will teach you a language in a way that you can really use the language in any other way than scratching the surface, or what you need when you take a vacation, because you learn only the situations that RS teaches you, but I am sure you will be able to understand a lot more than you can actually say yourself, and that is already a huge accomplishment.   English I learned the classic way, in school, and I can express myself far more freely in English than in Italian. But anyone comparing 2 years of Italian (while working fulltime) to 8 years of English as a student (from age 10 - 18) would be a fool! So even though I did pass the C1 exam (in Italian) I would still not say that I am fluent in Italian. And it does annoy me reading the RS "success stories" where people tell you that by only using RS they are now fluent in the language. I dare to say they might think they are fluent, but they are not. I am much more rational.   Yes, I would use RS again, because it has helped me, but I know well that using RS does NOT make me fluent in any language.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Rosetta Stone does not make the claim that you will become fluent.  Even Jay Topper (head of customer success)says that it produces conversational fluency - allowing you to communicate with people in the foreign language.  The ONLY way that a person can get true fluency is to live and work in a country where the language is spoken and actually have to use the language daily in all situations.  Even with RS, you need to speak with native speakers outside of RS, read, write and listen to items in the target language.  RS gives you the building blocks that you need to venture out and continue the quest for language learning.  RS, like all other language learning products, tell you that you will speak a language, but fluency is  subjective - conversational fluency vs. native fluency vs educated native fluency.  Also, with the current version, you actually have the opportunity to speak with native speakers which adds to your confidence level.  No one becomes totally fluent in a language just through courses - you have to USE the language.  RS gave the building blocks for speaking German (and eventually Italian and who knows what other languages), and I appreciate it. For someone who is trying to learn a language, you will get the basis that you need, but, again, it is up to you to learn the language through interaction.  I have tried other products over decades, but this is the one that has held my attention and really helped me on the path to true fluency.  Before anyone starts judging, determine what "speaking a language" is.  IT is NOT native fluency!####$$##%POSITIVE

I like the "simplicity" of using the computer, The computer can not correct your mistakes, especially when you are speaking. There is no "format", no "introduction" to any verbs, nouns, etc  Everything is done with an arrogance, as if YOU SHOULD, know this..... Pictures, do not provide, enough info, to know what "it is" you are trying to conjugate or identify. I do not "like" getting any wrong answers, so it bothers me to get a low score. I guess I DO have higher expectations than others. I want to learn, the way its supposed to be. Thats all.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Jeffrey, if you're talking about the cost of Rosetta Stone, it is MUCH cheaper than my local university which charges $1,000 per unit.  It would cost me $4,000 for one semester of German!  But I'm getting more than a year (lots of interruptions) of study with TOTALe for less than 1/4 the price of one semester of university study.  And I'm learning to speak and understand MUCH better than when I studied Spanish and French in school.  Rosetta Stone ROCKS!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm with Michele.  I like doing them each twice.  For me, Studio is all about developing my confidence... and that second Studio session really boosts mine!####$$##%POSITIVE
Great!! Thanks, from now on I'm gonna do the sessions at least twice, I really enjoy having a "conversation" in my new language. And the coaches are really nice and helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
Swedish is not all that easy. Yes, no verb gender issues but Swedish has very specific words for specific situations. For example. there are four words for is, three words for of, etc. Many sayings do not translate to what they mean. For example: " Klockan ar mycket" means "it's late".   I think Martina brought up some good points. I think the Rosetta Stone commericials of late are a little misleading. The reality is the software itself is a Berlitz and people traveling to another country would take a phrase book than invest the time and money in Rosetta Stone. This is true of those languages that are offered to level three. This is why the tutors can make the world of difference within these language series if they are willing to go beyond the lessons.  I am able to read newspapers, I am able to understand half of advanced lectures and I am able to communicate and understand at fluency level (somewhat on the understanding end lol). However, I know I am not fluent and will not be until I have lived in the country for some time.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I think you didn't give the program a chance and got frustrated. If you stick with the program, you will eventually understand what the pictures mean because you will see it over and over again. Like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it. I have some issues with the speech recognition at times because before I can even say the first part of the word it  says I am saying it wrong, but when I go to the illustrations of the patterns that I should be making and the ones I made , I see what is wrong. I go over and over it until I pronounce it correctly. I take many studios every week which helps tremendously. I love the program and will be sorry i will have to leave it as I have finished all 3 levels of my program. I started with a very low level of Portuguese, and am doing so well now when I Skype with native speakers. It is amazing but I put a lot of time into it. Also, I think you have exaggerated a lot here. So it makes your opinion less valid. What program or Rosetta Stone costs $800 and then they ask you to pay more. Seems to me you are just a hater and want to come here and put down the program. Maybe you just copied someone"s program and don't have all of the features you need. If you are sincere, I don't think you would have to make exaggerated criticisms of the programs that are not true at all.####$$##%POSITIVE
Dear Miss Judy, I purchased all 5 levels and that is what I paid at Borders. I am sincere, otherwise why would I take the time to write? Do you actually think I have nothing better to do? Come on, This is  AMERICA, I am looking for help,  not your petty remarks!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Learning a language at the university of expensive - tuition, books, transportation.  Private tutors are even more expensive and you never know what you are going to get!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Kinda disappointed that the contest is open only to the US.  I know some countries have weird rules about contests, but Canada doesn't even tax any sort of winnings and should have been included RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I notice that the first thing that people say when you say that you bought RS for a language is how expensive it is.  Most people do not know what RS is (all the components), so to complain about the price as the first comment is a little irritating.  When I first saw the price, I was a little taken aback, but I did more research to see WHY it was pricey.  After the research, I realized that it really wasn't all that expensive for what you get.  As far as RS not working, I don't think that most people even give it a chance.  So many people are used to the way that they teach languages in school - grammar drills and translation - that they are hesitant to embrace something different.####$$##%POSITIVE
I can not believe that I learned english in school for so many years although I would have learned it more faster with Rosetta Stone.I needed 4 years to reach an intermediate level  (B1),  7 years to be on an solid advanced level (B2) and now i am proficient in english (c1). The funny thing is that now, i'm on a good way to reach B1- B2 of spanish in a short space of time. Rosetta Stone really encourages me to learn more languages. It works great. I think, we have to convince people of the contrary because learning a language can be exceptionally enjoyable.####$$##%POSITIVE
And along with what Janice said, folks also do not realize that RS price has come down quite a bit and what you get for the price has increased dramatically.  Imho, it's a great value.  But I think the RS method requires a certain attitude/personality type.  It's not going to be a fit for every learner.  But what amazes me is that, instead of saying "this isn't a good fit for my learning style", the dissatisfied few can get pretty aggressive.  I mean, the product comes with a **6 month** money back guarantee...what more could you want?####$$##%POSITIVE
@Suzanne - did you get it at Borders during their close-out sale?  Also, what type of help are you seeking?  People have given you their opinions, yet you keep slamming our opinions.  What do you actually want?  Please not that the comments, and your method of conveying them, you have posted haven't really given anyone the impetus to ascertain your needs.  Can you be more specific?####$$##%POSITIVE
Too bad.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As far as the initial question - I think that most are just "blissfully" ignorant.  It takes initiative to investigate and figure out what you are buying. It also takes initiative to really learn a language to the point where you can actually communicate beyond the basic tourist phrases.  Yes, RS came down in price quite a bit, and it still more than worth the price.  People need to get at least through the 2nd level before they criticize.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do Not Waste your money!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You would NOT waste your money.  I have to tell you that I am now in level 5 of German, and can understand so much more.  I get concepts rather than just words.  I was going to take Italian at the local college, but the cost was too much ($360 for ONE semester plus a book that was $285).  I got RS Italian, and after the first level I can communicate basics with native speakers over SKYPE and in person.  It is so rewarding!  The program is all about you - your pronunciation, your learning speed.  The studios are an excellent way to really test yourself with a native speaker BEFORE you go out to talk to natives.  After several decades of loving languages and cultures, this new RS, for me, is a wonderful way to get speaking languages that I could not before.  Just the studios themselves are more than worth the money.  Private tutors run upwards of $20 an hour.  I never knew what I was going to get.  In these studios, you only go over material that you have studied, and it really builds your confidence. I plan to buy other languages(Dutch, Portuguese) so that when I visit family and friends in Europe, I can communicate with the locals.  I believe that it is DEFINITELY worth MORE than what you pay.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, it is cheaper to get all three levels, because you can get the payment plan.  Buying each level as you go is actually more expensive, but if you think that you can pay for each completely, it might be for you.  The only "up" side is that each level, purchased separately, comes with its own 3-month subscription (and its own headset!)####$$##%POSITIVE
I started Swedish a few weeks ago and I'm already becoming comfortable reading and listening Swedish.  You definately have to put time and energy into the lessons.####$$##%POSITIVE
James, are you going through the extensive vocabulary with the tutors ? I started in March and took about a month off. I am so overwhelmed with vocabulary from Catharina and Malin that I am purchasing disk three next month lol.####$$##%POSITIVE

Me too Sharon! I'm learning Spanish next and hope to have Simy as a coach! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, I like RS because you don't have constant translation.  RS is geared to actually speak the language, not just to get a few phrases to use when traveling.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm thinking it could get confusing, but that's just me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have 16 years experience at being 29.  =)  I think many of us are more mature learners.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree, you get what you pay for!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree, too.  I have tried a lot of other products, and RS is thorough, and like a personalized course without the grade pressure.  The other products may be a way to supplement.  There is nothing wrong with being thrifty, but you have to know when it is a good idea and when it is not.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm turning sixty.  Besides being fun, language learning is recommended as a way to retain and improve brain function for older adults.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm older than you are, Michele, and though I grew up with French and Spanish, I plan to tackle Chinese and Japanese in a couple of months!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am 54 and loving my Spanish LA. I have 2 grandkids taking spanish in school and my daughter speaks spanish so she will be my buddy when I am actually speaking the language. Never to old to learn and it keeps the mind sharp.####$$##%POSITIVE
It will be confusing, but eventually you will be able to speak both without confusions. Children who are growing up with more than one language have to deal with the initial confusion, but end up speaking each language well.  Both languages are fun to learn and use, so I am sure that you will enjoy learning them.  Make sure that you do the studios - they are the key to successfully speaking the language!####$$##%POSITIVE
My suggestion is to get a good running start on one and then do the other.  If you have the goal of learning two languages consider whether simultaneous learning is really faster.  This may have to do with your talents and how much time you have.  However, with any languages there is learning and then there is practicing.   Once you get to the point where you have covered it all and now you are honing the skill, I think then it is fine to start a new language if you have the time.####$$##%POSITIVE
43 something fun to do!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't recommend Rosetta Stone for Japanese. Since I've been utilizing Rosetta Stone in Japanese class my grades have deteriorated to B's and C's. Native Japanese students and my teacher are often confused and say things like, "Well, hmm, we really don't say that," or "We really don't use those words," or "That structure isn't correct." It's OK if you want to get by as a tourist, but not as a student of the language.     Where Rosetta Stone fails is they teach a language from an English point of view. For example, in English we use the pronoun "you" a lot, so they teach that in their Japanese program as well in spite of the fact it is considered to be a very rude and impersonal thing to say to someone. Another example, "A woman and her dog." They teach in Rosetta Stone that the translation is, "onnanohito to kanojo no inu." That is grammatically correct, but the Japanese would never say that. They would just say, "josei to inu." The fact that the dog belongs to the woman or someone else is understood by the action between the two without being mentioned. Even more likely they wouldn't even speak of the woman or the dog since the subject is often omitted in conversation. I'm also not sure why they teach "onnanohito and otokonohito" for man and woman; the native speakers always use "josei and dansei" for man and woman.     Also the pictures and formats are the same for every language. This is why you get a lot of stuff that may be useless in a culture that isn't based on English.     I loved Rosetta Stone until I found out it was creating a barrier rather than overcoming one.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm 17 (a bit of a youngin), but I do have a firm philosophy that there is  no such thing as "too late to learn a language." Languages, like everything in life, can be accomplished at any age, anytime and anyplace. All one needs is the resolve and determination to tackle it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much for your quick response! That is a very reasonable pricing system.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, 15 months for $149. This includes unlimited studio sessions with native speakers and online games (an awful lot of them!)####$$##%POSITIVE
We are using Nakama 1 for Japanese 111, 122, and my current class 222, Intermediate Japanese. I was able to skip 111 and made an A in 122, but things aren't coming together so well for 222. I can still get an A, but I will have to scramble. I don't mind putting in the extra work, that's part of life. Its just that scoring in the 100 and 99 and 98% on Rosetta Stone exercises, practicing what is said, and doing all that work only to have a native speaker laugh at you, or your teacher tell you that its not right can be very discouraging. In fact, I go into silent mode or have Japanese natives speak in English around me now.    I like Rosetta Stone overall, and consider it really fun. Like I say, for some bragging rights or getting around as a tourist its great. Otherwise, it won't make you fluent or give the ability to hold a regular conversation.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm going to look up that book.  I will try any book or product that will help me with Japanese.  I do plan on moving there so I need to do as much studying that I can. I do agree that Japanese should not be taught from an English point of view.    I love my Genki textbook.  It's because of that book I can read and write in Japanese. The Kana characters, still working on Kanji.  When I got to 200 level in college it did get much harder. I'm only on level 1 of Japanese RS so I'm hoping level 2 starts dropping the "I" and "You." I like RS overall too but I do think people need more than RS to really understand languages like Japanese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm not sure about what Julie said, but buy the entire program if there is a 3-level or 5-level set as it saves $$. You get a 3-month subscription to the online portion, and then you can renew.####$$##%POSITIVE
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!! Go hire a tutor!####$$##%NEGATIVE
If you want to communicate then just get a dictionary and study with your acquaintances. Rosetta Stone Japanese is not for communicating at all. Its good for learning grammar rules and formal speech, but you will find that nobody in Japan talks they way they teach it. Check out some movies or a song sometime and compare them to see what I'm talking about.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hiring a tutor is expensive (more so than RS), and iffy.  With a tutor, they will charge you upwards of $20 an hour and may not have an actual plan.  I have been through that and it is NOT fun.  With RS< I KNOW that when I schedule a studio, the coach will be there.  I meet new people to practice the language, and I will get a structured lesson based on what I have learned.  That is an investment of money in yourself.  You can see yourself progressing and getting the confidence that you need to actually speak the language (my goal has always been communication).  Most of the naysayers either have never used it or can't figure out how to use it.  Buy it from RS and see what you think.  They do have a generous return policy.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you everyone for your answers to my question! This will really help me make a decision. Would truly like to learn Spanish once and for all.####$$##%POSITIVE
Unfortunately,  the programs do not give you everything that you need to be "fluent". All of them give you the structure, or the nuts and bolts, so that you can understand and go from there. I have spoken with people who have learned English, French and Spanish through RS ( I didn't learn any through RS, but as a child in places where these languages were spoken). None spoke like "natives", but then I would not suppose that they would. They had the basics, but needed help with more colloquial speech. That is to be expected from any person just learning the language. I WANT to learn the basics and then get to speak with natives to refine my speech. Very few people can just pick up a dictionary and speak a language.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Agreed. It works.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Danielle.  They are all right, the program works, but only if you make it work.  It works if you really work hard at it and practice often.  You'll get out of it what you put into it.  Buena suerte!!####$$##%POSITIVE

Gilberto, it might be good for traveling as a tourist, but the Rosetta Stone Japanese, for the most part, is very inaccurate according to native speakers. It might seem to have served you well, but Japanese people generally won't criticize a foreigners use of their language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
rofl Rosetta Stone.  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that you can only have online for the levels that you have purchased.  If you purchase only level 1, then only studios for level 1.  Also, I believe that if you purchase the online course (instead of the disks) you can access all levels within that time period as well as the studios and games.####$$##%POSITIVE
The online program is worth it for me. It keeps me interested and it's fun. I play the games and participate in the studio sessions that are also fun. It's interesting to really know that all of it is working. I purchased the Japanese set and when I use the i-phone app or listen to the audio on iTunes I get mental images of the spoken words as I repeat them. I recently went to Japan and practiced what I learned through Rosetta. That was fun and exciting.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do not purchase this!!!!!!! It will NOT HELP YOU!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

And they will ship right away, you can start using the program before you have paid for it.  If you are not happy within six months, you can return it no questions asked for a full refund.####$$##%POSITIVE
how much for the whole kit?####$$##%POSITIVE
Which language do you want?  Some languages have 3 levels and some 5 levels.  The 3-level kit is $399 and the 5-level kit is $499.  Doing the math, a 3-level kit will be about $80 for the last four payments.  The first payment will be $80 plus sales tax if your state has sales tax, and if RS has a store/kiosk in your state.  For the 5-level kit, payments will be about $100 a month, and again, the first payment will be more because you may have to pay tax.  There is also an online option that is about$200 for 3 months and $300 for 6 months.  You get access to the whole program, plus the online classes (studios) and online games.  The difference is that with the kit, you can keep the course forever.  You only get access to the course through the online portion for the duration of the subscription. I bought the kits for the languages that I am studying, and I started level 1 in early April and, working about 2 hours a day, finally got to level 5 by mid-August. There is a lot of material and a lot to really get you to speak the language of your choice.  I hope that helps.####$$##%POSITIVE

Hey Andra, I've done a few studio sessions (7 or 8) and have not had a negative experience yet.  The teacher/tutors have all been amazing, helpful and really great to deal with.  I'd really suggest if you had an unfortunate encounter contact the concierge services and inform them of the issue you encountered (mainly if it involved a tutor) and just get back to it.  Don't let the one experience ruin it for you.  They are a great way to learn and pick up some more words.    What was the issue you had?  If it was a fellow learner, I'd not worry too much.  The chances are always there to have a learner that is not very considerate but in most cases you shouldn't have a problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
Most of my studios have been wonderful experiences.  A couple weren't - but it was because of the other students, not the coach.  If there is a problem with the coach, you need to let RS know.  If there is a problem with the students, you also need to let RS know.  Even if you have one bad studio, you can't let that stop you from the studios, because they are a great way to practice the langauge!####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish has 5 levels. There is Spanish of Latin America and Spanish of Spain.  Both will get you speaking Spanish. The only difference is some pronunciation and some vocabulary, but people understand each other from both places.####$$##%POSITIVE
Andra, I would ditto everything others have said.  Please give Studio another try.  They are such valuable learning experiences.  I wish you great success as you learn your new language.  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Do not do it!!!!! Do not waste your money!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I loved my studio sessions until I got to level 3.  Then the other students were at level 5  and I was so intimidated.  I got off track during the summer, but am doing all of my reviews and almost ready to try try again.####$$##%POSITIVE
This is probably the best language product available.  The studios alone are more than worth the price.  In addition, the support that RS provides, both technically and learning-wise, is very complete.  I'm sure that there are a lot of people on this board who will definitely support this view.  If anything, it is a great start to help you start your language journey.  You do have to supplement it with talking to natives (over SKYPE, in person), and reading in the new language.  Fortunately, there are a lot of ways to do that over the internet.  Good luck, and have fun - let us know how you do!####$$##%POSITIVE
As an educator of ELL students myself, I realize that I must differentiated my instruction to meet the needs of the students where they are, and I didn't feel the coach in the studio session was good at dealing with my language pace or level.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ah, now it is time to learn languages that are not so easy for English speakers!####$$##%POSITIVE
Do your settings refer specifically to the Microsoft headset?  If you didn't already, restart your computer after the first time you connect the headset.  Plug in the headset FIRST then start RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes, I've done all of those things.  I may have to look into something other than the microsoft life chat.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you very much christy. Unfortunately, I'd already done all of these things. I even went as far as to disable the microphone & speakers associated with the laptop while keeping the headset enabled & as the default.  I will continue to try to fix the problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for clarifying that Dennis!  I am very happy to know that it will be available AFTER I finish German!  I want to make sure I keep my skills up :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, John and Dennis, for that great info!  And Michele, I think this is a fantastic question.  Like Alexander, I was thinking a little more "real world", but it's great to know that RS has created an opportunity for us.  I'm actually planning on volunteering at a hospital (and perhaps the airport).  In our location, we have several international business which could open another opportunity.  Ty for asking the question...the feedback really helped me! =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hugs to Liam!####$$##%POSITIVE
OOh Liam, good tip on that one.  As was mentioned earlier, its not a place to go if your around level 1 or 2 of a 5 level program.  Its really good for those that have finished the course and really want to hone what they've learned.####$$##%POSITIVE
No worries....but yes, make sure you are able to/willing to engage in your language at a fairly good level. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
You guys have great ideas!  I am so glad I will have things to do after Rosetta Stone!  I am in Level 2 now (and after I finish German, I plan on tackling another language!)####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh wow! I am in AP Italian right now and using RS Italian to prepare for the exam in May. Thank you for an inspiration.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's wonderful Patrick! I think that the prices are low, too - based on what you get!  @RS - you should put Patrick's comments on your website.  It is very inspiring!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow!  How phenomenal!  Patrick, thanks for sharing!  And I totally agree with Janice...comparing those prices to 2 years paying for college courses and it's a huge bargain.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thats awesome, Thats my goal too is to go to learn some languages before I get the chance to go to school. Everyones right, but I think that RS should put you on TV to tell your success story, I wish you the best of luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is truly incredible.  Did you also watch German TV?  Read German magazines and newspapers?  Change you setting on your computer and mobile to German?  German music?  German websites?####$$##%POSITIVE
Congratulations Patrick that is wonderful news--I am struggling with Hebrew but will persevere !####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you everyone! I actually did not read any newspapers or watch any German movies or tv, but I did listen to quite a bit of German music. It helped very much because it was lyrical, easier to remember, and very expressive. It's all so much fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
I would like to thank Leticia for getting back to me via email and apologizing about the mix up.  Thank you Rosetta Stone and Leticia!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm also learning Swedish but never seem to find anyone online at the same time as me with whom I can play some of the games. What level are you at?####$$##%NEGATIVE
So interesting. I'm glad to know there are still places on Earth we havn't messed around with yet.####$$##%POSITIVE
This is amazing, it is great that these relics survived there time in the earth.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta, fascinating article. Its amazing to see a small well explored area still hold its share of unkknown.####$$##%POSITIVE
WOWWWW!####$$##%POSITIVE
Likely, One of my ancesters.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the link. Just took a look and think it's beautiful to keep these languages alive.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey James, I updated as well but found I was having the same problem.  While a pain in the butt, the way to workaround the issue is to uninstall the app and reinstall it.  It's a pain because you have to redownload the files but it does fix it.  Hopefully RS can come up with a patch to fix the issue. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have to reinstall the app and ALL the languages that went with it...all the lessons and units, and levels?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey Christy.  Sorry, my dear, I do have to re-download EVERY LEVEL and UNIT and LESSON!  All 5 Levels of Spanish and ALL 5 levels of Swedish...Doing it as we speak.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Aaah okay, I see. Thanks for the quick response!####$$##%POSITIVE
That is what I love about this group, you can always count on someone knowing what to do!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think Rosetta Stone will take You to Level B2 even if you learn up to Level 5. This software teaches vocabulary mostly...and grammar is also needed. Or does it teach all tenses, modal verbs, conditional sentences, too??? :o####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did all four lessons of unit one lesson one. The representative in the studio session was irritated with both me and the other person doing the live session. First he told the other person to go back and review the lesson and shortly after that he told me to do the same. Both of us were not able to understand his sentences or respond in the manner he was expecting. As I said, I scored very well at matching the sentences to the pictures but still cannot put a sentence together on my own. I really want to continue but am really frustrated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The reason why RS can deliver their products is that all the language courses are the same, varying only by the language itself.  The courses crucial feature is about pronouncing, speaking, responding in a spoken language.   ASL obviously is about signing and so a completely different technology would be needed to provide something like the RS learning psychology for a non spoken language.   The market is also rather narrow for what would be the most expensive course they might ever produce as it would only work for signing based language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Its a good program, I love it, y estudio espanol en Rosetta Stone y es bueno.####$$##%POSITIVE
justamente me interesa el aleman e ingles...muchas gracias...####$$##%POSITIVE
+ i have 1.2.3 lessons and they are not FULL, when i come to 3rd Lesson i can't open it. Why?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Reggeli - This is HUNGARIAN for breakfast, probably misspelled. Rosetta, why don't you have HUNGARIAN?####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks very much Edward. I have decided based on the wonderful feedback received here to try it again. So thank you everyone!! I thought I was going crazy and really dissapointed in myself!! I am going to reschedule another studio session and hopefully will not get the same person!! thanks very much to everyone!!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Dennis RS Success.  A really good feature to add to your program would be an automatic statement about needing an activation code. Then people who have gotten a pirated copy would know as soon as possible.  Perhaps then can take some steps to get their money back.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got my RS Spanish(latin america) last tuesday, and I am already past level 1 unit 3 and by next week or the week after I should be on level 2, but it also depends on the person, I agree with James when he says you have to move forward, but at the same time If you dont understand something, I try and go back and figure it out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, well then I guess I've been doing it wrong then. It took me an entire year to complete level 1, lol. I did exactly what James said not to do, "Don't wait until you have every word and phrase down perfectly." Part of the reason it took so long though was because I spent 3 - 4 months away from it. So that set me back almost to day one. Typically I would go through a lesson, and I would just keep doing the courses for it over and over again until I had each phrase and word memorized. So I guess I'll have to stop doing that. But what if I really don't get what the material means, or if I have a difficult time saying it? Keep moving on anyways?####$$##%NEGATIVE
There isn't any real reason to stay on a level or unit forever. The program is set up to refresh the past things you learn as you progress.  Just try to spend 30 mins a day in the program and move with it.  With the way you were studying you have more rote memorization than actual retention. I say this b/c you stated after 3 months you were back to square one.  I think if you work through the program as is and really take advantage of Studio and the games, you will retain more. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Spanish, and already speak French. At times I find myself pronouncing Spanish words as if they were French. During one of my studio sessions the language coach asked me (in Spanish) if I spoke French. Guess it must have been coming through LOL! I must say that the Rosetta Stone method seems much more efficient than the way that I was taught French in high school and college.####$$##%POSITIVE
Done...thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, Jennifer:  I am almost finished with RS German (L5U3) and learning Italian (L1U4).  I study one a night for about an hour (German one night, Italian the next). I will be finished with German soon, and plan to start Japanese in December.  It isn't hard, but since I have more experience with German than Italian, I tend to lean more towards German.  If I remember correctly, you studied Italian in school.  You just have to schedule time, because it can get a little difficult if you don't schedule each language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I wasted my money on this and it's crap!!! There is no way to learn Spanish from Rosetta Stone, so don't waste your money. You'd do better putting that money towards tuition for a class a a community college or something!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Brenda, I'm sorry you've had a bad experience.  I am having a fabulous time learning Spanish with Rosetta Stone.  I'm picking up much more quickly than I ever have in a classroom environment and appreciate that I can do it at my own pace and on my own time.  I think every learning environment has its pluses and minuses and I wish you great success in finding the perfect environment for you!  =)  Our family had the opportunity to go to Epcot for a couple days last week.  I'm pretty sure we were the only English speakers there.  =)  It literally brought tears to my eyes to listen as my son conversed with people in Japanese.  And I enjoyed eavesdropping on French, German and Spanish conversations even though I couldn't muster the courage to jump in and speak!  =)  I'm sure after using Studio for a while that I'll build confidence and take the plunge!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had a fabulous time learning japanese. Even though I am not currently using it, I can converse in japanese with natives. Learning japanese with RS is fun and engaging!( I wish they had levels 1-5 for japanese).####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Geoffrey and Tracie! I will try using my logitech headphones ####$$##%POSITIVE
In a few months, I hope i can answer your question directly!  =)  Until then, here's a story from the RS blog... http://blog.rosettastone.com/2011/10/14/luna-di-miele-italiana/  I would say the answer to your question is "absolutely!".####$$##%POSITIVE
I am almost finished with German (all five levels), and I can converse and I am conversationally fluent.  I speak to people on SKYPE and in person.  As far as "fluent", "fluent" like a native speaker comes with living and working in the country where the language is spoken.  RS helps you get the nuts and bolts, and gets you to actually speak the language. I have to say that it is more than most classrooms because the study is individualized, your pronunciation is corrected, and you can have classes totally in the language.  I still have problems communicating in German because, when speaking with a native speaker there are words and idioms that I just don't know.  So, yes, you can converse after finishing RS and you will have more confidence, but you will not have the wealth of vocabulary that a native  speaker has because they have accumulated the vocabulary over years.  RS is an excellent investment to start learning and then you can use the resources on the net or in your community to improve.####$$##%POSITIVE
janice is right! I also think that Rosetta Stone is a programm that gives you the basis for fluency, especially if you have a 5 level version like german.Speaking to native speaker on skype is a really good way to practise your language and yeah...i recommend it to all of you -  it makes so much fun.Moreover i would say that it is easy to learn the romanic languages because the sentence structure of french,spanish,italian etc. are similar.If you speak a germanic or romanic language i think it would'nt be so confusing.Everything depends on your motivation..the most important thing is PRACTISE!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just bought Japanese this weekend.  I bought it because I have a large active Japanese community in my town. I have some acquaintances who have volunteered to help me learn the language. Also, I have taken classes in Japanese and haven't been able to stick to it (due to time constraints).  Chinese might be a better language to learn because China is upwardly mobile now, and you may have more opportunities to use it than Japanese.  Actually, which one are you considering?####$$##%POSITIVE
Yay!  I'm glad you did a session!  There is a "live help" button at the bottom of the studio screen.  If you have an echo, feedback, etc during the session, you can click that and a tech support person will "magically" show up and help you fix it.  I know with me it took some tweaking.  I hope your next session is even better!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I told you it wouldnt be bad, I am happy that your studio session went well. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I noticed a couple of posts where people talked about other learners laughing during the studios.  I have never had that experience - laughing at someone.  Maybe they are nervous, but I can't imagine laughing at someone in a learning environment.  Can RS post something about being courteous in the sessions?####$$##%POSITIVE
In one of my Studio sessions we were all laughing *with* another learner. He was telling us about a girl that had become the object of his affection, and the Studio session turned into a conversation on dating advice, all in the foreign language! While we departed from the usual format of looking at pictures and answering questions posed by the coach, it was very interesting, educational, and fun to engage in conversation among the learners in the language we were all studying, of course still under the direction of the coach. We all had a good laugh; and I believe that we all learned a lot as well. It felt like "speaking outside the box".####$$##%POSITIVE
ok! thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
William - In the studios where we laughed, it was fun because the conversation turned to something funny.  I enjoy jokes and funny stories in the language!####$$##%POSITIVE
And i am so excited that we plan to do our vows in gaeilge. He is fluent so he will have no problem. I am not far enough along yet, but I am sure he will help me with our irish vows :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks John, I am really feeling down about it cause this is one of my flaws but I am sensitive to what other people say about me or when I am laughed at, but I will give it a few hrs and I will try to forget about it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
OMG are you kidding, they laughed at you!  Now I am scared.  I went to my first one and was so intimidated I left after 2 minutes.  I am scheduled to retake it in 20 minutes, NOW I don't want to go!  If they laugh, I will never be able to go back.  I am so sorry Donald.  No one should ever laugh at someone who is trying to learn something new!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Roberta I dont think that will happen with you, dont be nervous, even though I am a little down now, I am not going to stop going to sessions, my thing is I didnt know that the instructor wanted me to ask another person a question, and I heard one of them laughing, not once, but twice, its the first time it happened and I this is my 3rd session. @Dennis Thanks Dennis I appreciate it man, I am not going to give up but it breaks my heart sometimes to see how people can be so ignorant.@Sharon Mucho Gracias I really do appreciate it, I am more than willing to try and motivate someone to learn a language, I can take a lot of crap, but I really cant take someone laughing at me if I make a mistake.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have never seen that happen in a Studio session!####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald - I think people may giggle when they are nervous.  You were probably being questioned on something they may have been insecure about. I had that happen to me, too,  laughing can be an automatic reaction to nervousness.  They may have also been nervous FOR you.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you for your prompt response!  I am sad that you don't make them any more but it encourages me to memorize where the letters are!  thank you so much and you have a great weekend!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that I know what you mean!  When you are in the country, people just speak at you.  There isn't any structure or teaching.  RS is a teaching tool, and you learn in pieces.  That was my problem with German.  I tapped into the community in my town to learn German, but I did not have the language pieces that I needed to form sentences, and understand what they were saying.  Now, after almost 5 levels of RS, I understand so much more, and when with native speakers, I can understand and response.  The "fear factor" is still present, but not so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
^_^ That is exactly how I feel!! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Prospero is the best game of the bunch.  A great way to really help you put words together to create sentences.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Tom, I'm learning the same language and find prospero to be very beneficial as its great at giving a bit of grammar and how to properly put sentences together.####$$##%POSITIVE
It finally let me go passed it but it only gave me a 73% (Because it wouldn't let me do the last 2 slides!) so I don't have a checkmark.  I don't want to have to go back and do it again just for it to not let me finish it again!####$$##%NEGATIVE
michele good look with german ;) viele liebe grüße####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Christy!  I am clicking the link now :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just don't understand how to play it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!I sure will.####$$##%POSITIVE
Best of luck to you!  I hope you have a fabulous time learning Vietnamese!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone progarm is interesting and unusual progam compared to any other learning language program,because it dont use my language but only use the language i want to learn and needs only  intuition not having go to think about language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well Rosetta Stone is considered the best language learning software in the world####$$##%POSITIVE
the program is great, i love it. I just wish the prices were a little lower####$$##%POSITIVE
yes it is:-) I used it in my first weeks in Mexico, it helped progress fast in the language learning, and move around much easier and with more confidence, because you get to learn to understand the accent, etc..but note that in Rosetta Stone, it's probably the Venezuelan accent , depending on where you'd go, some items might have different names, some phonetics might sound different, but not unrecognizable. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
*helped me####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I have the Spanish, you just need to put in the time to do the activities, if you are a busy person it will be hard.####$$##%POSITIVE
If you want to learn a new language there is only 1 possible way that could be better than Rosetta Stone. That is to live in that country. Even then it is more likely not to be better than Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely worth it. It put me permanently on the path of learning Spanish. Changed my life.####$$##%POSITIVE
I figured it out.  Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm loving my Latin american Spanish level 1-5... It's something fun to learn and it's all worth it####$$##%POSITIVE
I do, you do, he does, they do, we all do....####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the Mandarin Rosetta Stone and it's an incredible and effective way to learn another language. I'm sure the Spanish is just as great, because Rosetta incorporates, the visual, listening and writing skills that reinforce memory####$$##%POSITIVE
Dear Rosetta Stone:  I am a single mother who enrolled my child in a Spanish immersion school because of my love of the language and my appreciation of bilingualism.  I have been using workbooks, flashcards, misc. software, to learn the language, but to no avail.  I know your program is best, but can't afford it.  Pleeeeaasssee send me a coupon code so I can get the program, learn the language and help myself and my daughter become bilingual.  Thanx in advance =D####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, on their website, they only offer the online course.  I do not see the option to purchase the CDS.  I WANT the CDS, not the total online course and program.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do have it on full screen. I can read single lines ok but when it goes to multiple lines it makes it half the size and I have great difficulty seeing it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why don't you offer the CDs anymore?  I think that most people like the idea that they can go back to the course.  I certainly hope that you are not considering doing all the courses online.  For me, it would be a deal breaker.####$$##%NEGATIVE
no####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. <3####$$##%POSITIVE
I am actually pretty impressed with the recommendations people are so freely giving. I am going to check into this further a little closer to Feb. When we will have the extra finances to purchase. I figure if my daughter can learn from this she should have an easier time in spanish class which will free her up with her other studies and sports. =)  Thank you all for your help with my questions, I am now excited!!! =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. <3####$$##%POSITIVE
LOVE IT!  How about a weekly news email or something in your target language.  I would love that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had her when I did level 1 unit 1 on my spanish la, she is a sweetheart and she made the session real fun, I hope I get her cause I am on level 1 unit 4 right now, i should be finished with it by the end of this week or by the middle of next week.####$$##%POSITIVE
She was definitely a sweetheart.  I must commend you on how fast your getting through the language Donald.  From what I've seen you post you seem to have quite the knack for languages.  Aside from my 3 months this summer that I had to break away for personal reasons, it's taken me 4 months to get Level 1 completed.  But back into I go and still loving every minute of it.  :D####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the German one, and my girlfriend is learning Japanese####$$##%POSITIVE
I went through the first two levels of that edition over about 6 months and learned as much if not more than I did in two years of college-level German.  I traveled to Nicaragua following completion and was able to tell stories and be understood by the Nicas.  Great investment!####$$##%POSITIVE
I know exactly of what speak you, but if I add this would be the Yes####$$##%POSITIVE
I would recommend it!  Learning Spanish is something I've always wanted to do and I feel Rosetta Stone is really helping me to succeed!####$$##%POSITIVE
Absolutely worth the money.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well worth it! =)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's not it because I have done them and the one writing activity I've redone 3 times now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's well worth it to me. I am still on the first CD but I already understand people who speak Spanish better.####$$##%POSITIVE
Can help with the learning, but you really need someone to practice with or on who already knows the language. Might I add that totale studio sessions are not your best choice!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im learning Japanese language on my own, I got a grip on the language but still need someone to practice with, someone serious####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm soon try Rosetta soon ####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning french and it is the best!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
shane I am learning spanish now latin america. I am on level 2 of 5 levels. It teaches so well. I enjoy each and every lesson. Complicated? Not really, main thing is dont stop. Act like its ur routine. You must challenge yourself a little, dont take breaks. I dont use the online help though. I go to chatrooms and find actual spanish speaking people. Its amazing when you realize how muvh you know!   Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh yes, learned more in my first week then a year in school. Just stick to it. The milestones can be challenging but you'll make it through them and be like "wow I did that"..####$$##%POSITIVE
It is soooo worth it, Get it, you wont believe how easy it is!!!! And in no time you'll be speaking espanol !!!####$$##%POSITIVE
this is all my exp with the japanese version. the totalE editions can be a bit confusing at times... as the further i go the more i depend on opening a word translator. be prepared that you will have zero native words in your program and no way at all to tell what a word might be trying to tell you... i know the japanese language can be hard to learn but,  translator program or book would help a ton for those random "WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF is this showing me" moments####$$##%NEGATIVE
Shayne, you'll get out of it what you put into it.  It may take you over a year to complete all five levels.  If you do a little bit every day, say 30 minutes or so, and take advantage of the online coaches (Studio sessions), you'll be conversational in Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'd say it's not really worth the money, but I don't think that's the answer RS is looking for. o_O####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Really Sarah? I've just finished level one.  the nouns are pretty easy it's the Ella, and esta and este those types of things I'm having trouble with.  I looked into taking a college course but talked to many people, some with two years of spanish which cost alot more then RS, that don't know as much as I do after level one.  It is kind of pricey but you get what you pay for.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have studied other foreign languages in about every format & method possible.  With the exception of an in country immersion program RS is by far the best language program available.  If you take advantage of the Studio Sessions you will find that this program is much better than a college course which will cost you a lot more. ####$$##%POSITIVE
@Rosetta Stone thank you for the info.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
If you are self-disciplined to work regularly on something without a scheduled time, it's excellent. Just be sure to do the Studio sessions -- live practice is key.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got RS for Christmas last year.  Have I timed out on Totale?####$$##%NEGATIVE
As expensive as Rosetta Stone is, I don't think I want to pay for an upgrade. It should be included. Then when I purchase the next levels, I will have the current.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wonderful! I couldn't find it, would you please post the link and or info? Recall there was a 3 month tutorial available with the headset. Interested in continuing European Spanish and Hebrew for now. Would like to be conversationally fluent in 5 languages before I die LOL <long term goal. : )####$$##%POSITIVE
kool####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't find the link either and would really like to order.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think the program is fairly priced. If you take a language course at a collage,you would pay more than this for one semester. You would not have a 1 to 2,3,or 4 ratio in the teaching sessions, like studio. If you studied with Berlitz or Inlingua, you would be paying thousands. You can get a new language also for the same price if you exchange it within 6 months. I think you guys should check around at how much it costs to learn another language. You want something for nothing and that just doesn't happen. Stop belly aching.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much for the discount.  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I think this is a great program to start off with, once RS adds more languages to the program, it will be even better. @alana the accent is different and some words are different, for example the word for juice in spain is zumo, in latin america its jugo, Laptop in spain is portatil, La is just laptop, sunglasses in spain is gafas de sol, In la spanish its antejos de sol, word for bedroom is spain is habitacion and in Latin america its dormitorio, but other than that its not a super big difference, its like american english and british english, either way your bro will be fine, but I would get the La spanish since he is here in america, but if he plans on going to spain, then he should get the spanish from spain.####$$##%POSITIVE
Very interesting, Donald.  So have you already gone through the Spain version then?####$$##%POSITIVE
its a very good company i have learned 9 new languages in 2yrs####$$##%POSITIVE
I learned L.A. Spanish and I had no trouble understanding or being understood in Spain. There is a little difference in grammar also besides the vosotros, called leismo  used in Spain where they use le instead of lo for the masculine direct object. These things are very minor. Oh yes, and the curse words are different!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hurrah for Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
This is so exciting! I'm perfecting my German and learning Japanese. I could definitely use these. Keep up the good work!####$$##%POSITIVE
As when I learned greek, I learned there is no substitute to immersing yourself in the culture and forcing yourself to speak it, all while enforcing what you've learned through class or Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
it is good####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the Latin America Spanish! and the studio part is amazing! I was very surprised, actually, that I'm not bored at all during what is often a 50 minute lesson. I often go longer  and feel frustrated with my lack of time right now to study the way I want to.####$$##%POSITIVE
Anyone wanting to learn a foreign language should give RS a try. What do you have to lose?  You can make payments on it, and if you don't like it, you can return it. The program works. I have a library of Spanish books, but learned more by RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
I purchased mine this past January. In the middle of the summer, I was busy and got away from it.  I have now returned to it. I look forward to quiet evenings at home with RS, these chilly autumn nights, doing what I love best, that of learning a foreign language. By the way, don't think it is easy.  If learning a foreign were easy, then everyone would know a second language or more.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would say yes. The Studio part is really helpful b/c it forces you to speak in your language. I was a little nervous with my first one but it's a really fun experience.  The price isn't too bad if you catch it on sale.  You can also pay for it in full or do monthly payments.  If you don't like it you can send it back within 6 months. ####$$##%POSITIVE
It misses out a lot of the exercises, and also seems to accept a much lower standard of input on voice recognition, but its obviously more flexible in location etc - I like having the choice of either####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Maya.  I'm heavily debating getting an iPad, primarily because of RS.  Your feedback helps.  (And thanks RS)####$$##%POSITIVE
Same here####$$##%NEGATIVE
German.  I have been on RS for1 month now and not one time have I seen someone logged in other than me.  For Simbio it would have to be someone learning English.  I guess there aren't enough people learning English!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love that each of the Studio facilitators really has his/her own style.  It really gives us a great experience as learners!  (And Simy, you are fabulously supportive!  Great folks like you are what make RS the fun and effective learning experience it is!)####$$##%POSITIVE

Hi Rick, it's one thing to give your opinion, it's another to make such comments and not back them up with any sort of reasoning.  As to the contrary, the program has done really well for me and find it very beneficial.  Please be more precise before slandering a great company. ####$$##%POSITIVE
So when should you slander someone (thing)....Before or AFTER they've screwed you? BTW it isn't slander unless it is not a proven fact and you don't know, do you?  I think they were unfair to me because their promotions did not say that the entire package is time limited.  I bought a course and I can't expect to use all six levels in a short period of time. Then again their response to my question was beyond their promise of "24 hour response" so they lied.  The on line notification on trying to log in are not informative.  So you're a company man? Is that it?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rick, I'm sorry you've had a negative experience.  I've been a Rosetta Stone for 7 years and through 3 different languages and I've had a fantastic experience with the company and my interactions with their employees.  For me, I've found the most timely and effective communications are via the chat mechanism on the RS website and with the concierges here on FB.  I wish you success in finding a solution to your issue.####$$##%NEGATIVE
On the page for Rosetta Stone Japanese, I'm used to seeing a list of levels of software that can be bought. Now the same page only lists a $20 a month subscription option. This is the page I'm seeing here:  http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-japanese####$$##%NEGATIVE
I didn't know they had six levels to any language.   I do agree that six months is not enough time for a six level course.  I hope you find a solution to your problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've had that same problem on the U.S site when I looked up Hebrew, Korean and Japanese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As recently as a month ago I looked and they still had lessons 1, 3, and 3 available. I'm feeling a little concerned about whether I'm going to be able to continue my language learning practice as I had hoped to.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Rick - I've used it and I could not disagree with you more.  I've also learned and tried to learn languages in each of the other methods available.   Compared to failing with some methods and only maybe succeeding with ones that are more expensive - you could not be possibly more inaccurate, wrong or rude.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Rick Neither John nor I or anyone but the clearly labeled RS rep are "Company Men" we are happy customers who do not like to see someone speaking ill of something that has given us such pleasure and value.   Your rant utterly lacks specificity so I am left wondering what on earth has so annoyed you as to be so rude.####$$##%POSITIVE
I found out around that time too.  I wonder what will happen to languages when they go up to 4 & 5.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As Geoffrey mentioned, happy customers defending a product does not equal "company men".  I merely asked you to explain yourself and your comments.  Now I'm not sure which promotion you were speaking of but if you ordered online and you clicked on the learn more link you'd find at bottom of the page that opens a note that states "Free 3 months access included with purchase for one user."  As Sharon said, good luck on finding a solution.  In the future might I suggest refining your comments before spouting them.####$$##%POSITIVE
I highly doubt RS intends for anyone to complete a program in 6 mths.  It IS enough time for anyone to finish 1 or possibly 2 levels. You should know after the first level if it's worth keeping. ####$$##%POSITIVE
@Geoffrey i know that but it's not correct 100%####$$##%NEGATIVE
Simy, did you see my post above? haahaha It was after a class with you that I decided to repeat Studio level 2, unit 1 again for the 5th or 6th time. Good job though.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'll try that, thanks :)9####$$##%POSITIVE
mucho éxito! cuándo empezaste a aprender el español latinoamericano? Donald i know that you are ambitious enough to master that language one day. Keep it up! Best wishes!####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually yes you did, thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow Latin sounds very intense! and difficult to truly learn the language well.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would love to study Polish,as my grandmother is Polish.  I'm studying Russian now so I'm hoping it will be easier when I do get to it####$$##%POSITIVE
Polish is high on my list.  My grandfather was German but he was born in Poland.  He spoke fluent German, Polish and Russian so those are the languages I am interested in.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Janice- Nokiding?  That is so cool!  My great-grandfather, my grandmother's dad, was born under Czar Nicholas II (same one assasinated by the Bolsheviks).  Though his citizenship papers are in Russian (partly why I study it), he always professed to be Polish.  My grandmother spoke it fluently as a child with her parents, but less and less as her family passed.  So much like you, I want to learn it for the family connection :)####$$##%POSITIVE

Hi Chaney, I was just messing around here and clicked on the store link on the left.  They have a special for facebook; $100 off all 5 levels plus free shipping.####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely got to check those out!####$$##%POSITIVE
simply stunning , I really appreciate it , thanks Rosetta Stone :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I saw them on my trip to Isreal, just amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
I got to see them when they came to San Diego on tour, amazing is right.  If you didn't believe in God before, how could you not after seeing all the different scrolls.  They were documentation, which was even more solidified in the lease/mortgage/rental scrolls on display.  If it was important, they wrote it down.####$$##%POSITIVE
Watched it earlier - thanks for a wonderful post!####$$##%POSITIVE
alright, thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Unit two felt like a jump for me too. However, my issues were quickly ironed out in RS studio sessions.####$$##%POSITIVE
A "real" teacher will cost more than renewing the studios.  Though I am not doing Hebrew, I got more out of the studios for the languages that I am learning than I have from a tutor who isn't following a specific course. Of course, everyone must make their own decision.  Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just need some kind of anchor point in reality. I just went through the first lesson in unit 2 and I 'think' they are talking about 'family' but I'm not sure. I learned nothing from this lesson. Nothing. Going to have to ask someone what on earth they are talking about.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I already paid for the studios, which I never got to use, so I am not paying for them again. I was told that I would be contacted about renewing the studios and was never contacted. So I am not impressed at this time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Actually, you can renew over the internet through your program.  They don't have to contact you.  I do have to say that I find the studios much more engaging (and cheaper) than a private tutor.  You may be lucky and get a really good tutor, but I have been through a lot of tutors in three different languages, and have learned more with the studios than any tutor.  Also, it is unfortunate that you didn't get to use the studios after you paid for them.  Maybe Hebrew studios are not as plentiful, but I can imagine that you would have more one-on-one than in Spanish or French.  If it helps, you can print out the transcript in Hebrew, and the related on in American/British English. As they use the same base, that might help you out.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bristle at the idea of paying for the studio AGAIN which I paid $557 for and which I never used, and which apparently expired before I could use it, so no more money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Can you give us some examples of the confusion?  What pictures?  As for "a real teacher" ... if you are "bristling" now, wait to you see the costs (and inflexible scheduling) of a classroom style.  You will not achieve what you could with RS in two semesters.   How much time a day did you spend on this?    I do agree with you that the subscription timer should not begin until the first actual use of studio, stories or games.   That would be more fair.   I've learned Arabic all three levels with RS and I doubt that Hebrew is harder.####$$##%POSITIVE
When you purchased the product, did you get 3 months or 15 months? If you got 15 months (which it seems you may have based on what you say you spent), then it is truly unfortunate that you did not get any studio time.  I got 3 months with each of mine and have used as much time as I can schedule.  If you pay for another 6 months, it is $75.  Most tutors want at least $20 an hour.  You can schedule as many studios as you want (limit two at a time).  I just got out of two back-to-back studios and have pages of notes to explain concepts, alternate ways of saying things and new vocabulary.  You can bristle at the idea of another $75, but think of the amount you would pay for a tutor without any guarantee.  The studios are geared to what you are learning and is a review AND can take it to the next level (as many as you like and about the price of one tutoring session).  If you like it, you can get more.  I think $149 for 15 months of unlimited studios and games is a great deal - but only if you make the time to use it.####$$##%POSITIVE

At my school we have a Latin America Spanish as a elective.I'm half way through level 1.So excited!####$$##%POSITIVE
Woohoo!  It's gonna be amazing when you hit that last milestone in lvl 5, look back, and realized that you taught yourself Spanish (with a little help from Rosetta Stone).  Congratulations to you on your accomplishment and wishing you great success moving forward!####$$##%POSITIVE
and it is awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree, it is####$$##%POSITIVE
Madeline, all their language products work the same and cover the same concepts in a similar sequence.  They all work.  If you buy direct from RS and are not satisfied within six months, you can return it for a full refund.  Give it a try and see for yourself.####$$##%POSITIVE
Madeline, I agree with Geoffrey...the best thing you can do is try it for yourself and, if not satisfied, return it within 6 months.  Our family has used the Japanese RS.  The one "trick" I learned was that it was easier for me to set the alphabet to "romanji" (which is Japanese written in the latinized alphabet) rather than tackle the symbolic alphabets straight off.  I'm an older learner, so this may not hold true for others.  But the RS method of learning a language is great and I highly recommend it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love learning Japanese with the characters. But I wish I could see Korean written out in English letters. That one is confusing to me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great answers!  I'm especially impressed with Rosetta Stone recognizing the Spanish (orig. from Spain) preserved in the north.  Since posting this, I asked my friends from Guatemala and Mexico, and generally, what they told me is that they would understand me whether I used a simplified past tense version of just 'e and 'o, or more correct and formal.  The varieties of spanish (and spanglish, for what it's worth ;) are so mixed here that I guess nearly anything goes.  Except, in the north.  BTW, when in NM, always if you must assume, address people as "Spanish" instead of latino, mexicano, mextizo, hispanic, etc. - just in case.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok that sounds perfect for me!!! How do you set up to where they make the payments monthly??####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thank you very much!! Will do that now!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thank you very much####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok sounds great I love it already!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, sad today because I have finished all three Levels of Swedish.  I am glad I still have a lot of time left on my Rosetta World.  I will continue to take Studios and play the games.  I do wish I could find someone in Duo or Simbio...hint hint.  I have never had luck with Swedish!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have a feeling you married a Moroccan guy... lol.  Not sure why anyone would want to learn Moroccan Arabic to be quite honest.  Mandarin seems much more interesting than a hummos dish mixed with caviar and papa rellena (French, Arabic, & Spanish) lol####$$##%POSITIVE
@ taylor! Thank you so much! you are right 100% Arabic is just arabic from different counrties. As for american each state is ther own countries govern but one large country. Any different ways on speaking, Just like arabic! Salam####$$##%POSITIVE
With 0% interest!####$$##%POSITIVE
I usually just do the lesson over. Also when you first start a lesson it asks you if you want to start over and erase all progress. Good luck and good that you made it so far.  I'm starting over tomorrow.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh Roberta...I'm so sorry your first session was a rough one.  Mine was a total disaster too!  (Scroll down about 10 posts and you'll see!)  I don't know if it'll help you, but I was actually signed up for the *wrong* Studio session.  I thought it was lvl 1, unit 1...and it was unit 4!  No wonder everyone else in there was so much more proficient than me!  It may be what happened to you too!  The other piece of "encouragement" I would offer is that your Rosetta Stone Studio time is yours!  =)  No one knows who you are and everyone is learning and growing through the same language.  It's the progress that *you* make that matters, so I would really encourage you just to take the plunge.  Honestly, I just said, "no se" (I don't know) through most of my session.  But each session will be better and better...and one day *we'll* be the one in the session who are "more advanced"!  Good luck in your next session and in gaining skills in your new language!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't know I could say I don't know.  Honestly, I had no idea what the coach was asking me.  I will try again but I don't think it will be too soon.  Thanks Sharon, I really appreciate your support.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Me too! I think u just need to delete the app and download it again! :)####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thanks.  I will definately update my progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
That worked!  I will bookmark it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be intresting if RS gets that language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Simon I've done French 1-5 and I would say it certainly exceeds GCSE and is a great starting point for A-Level study, which I plan to start in the new year. I use other language medias too in preparation for the A-Level as I've heard language A-Levels are very difficult and a big jump from GCSE.  I do feel, however, that RS has prepared me for such a challenge!####$$##%POSITIVE
There are 5 levels for each language.  I am finishing level 5  of German, and it is a wonderful program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the replies. I was toying with doing an OU course instead of this to get a qualification####$$##%POSITIVE
There are definitely some errors in the Arabic writing exercises... they need to be reviewed by Rosetta Stone experts and fixes need to be made.  I've also had some regular listening exercises (at level 3, I think) where the text has gone outside of the bubble.  It seems that there are also some text which doesn't match the audio, i.e. masculine endings when the text gives a feminine.  They are fairly rare, but enough to lodge a complaint about the QA control... doesn't seem like RS has done a thorough job here... at least for Arabic.  That being said, I'm anxious for them to release levels 4 and 5.  I just love the overall learning experience... especially from the core lessons.  For the next 370 days or so, all I have is the RS studios to improve with... But they are certainly worth the money.  And in the meantime, I've gone on to start learning Swedish, too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Check level 1 Unit 2.  That is where I began running into the problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
with such great coaches it's hard not to enjoy the sessions####$$##%POSITIVE
Mine first is scheduled for Monday. So happy yours went well! Do you get an e-mail to tell you where to go for the session?####$$##%POSITIVE
Sherry, above the studio button where you can "schedule", there will appear a button that says "attend".  Make sure your RS is on the same unit that your studio is scheduled for.  I hope you have a fabulous time!  =)  Studio is a great opportunity.####$$##%POSITIVE

Hello?  RS?  Do you still sell the 3-level discs for Japanese?  I am interested, but don't want total internet access.  I like having the course to refer back to lessons.  Thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just wish I could afford it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have payment plans! LOVE my Spanish one! and it is easy to learn, I failed language in HS and in College. But so am enjoying learning using Rosetta :D####$$##%POSITIVE
But ive heard GREAT things about Rosetta Stone % would love to try it!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
One advantage to the online subscription is that you get the Studio for the entire time, not just 3 months.####$$##%POSITIVE
Too expensive! Company would a much bigger market if tjey weren't charging so much!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Language is a long term thing for me. My RS course isn;t just like my classes offline weren't.####$$##%POSITIVE
Your experiences tutoring are very interesting, Ellen.  Thank you for sharing that.  Our family has been using Rosetta Stone for 7 years and we have just expanded to our 4th language.  While no system is perfect for every student, I find RS to be the best system out there for really *learning* a new language.  It's a great value.  The cost has gone down while the product offers more and more.  Absolutely love the new online features, games, studio, etc.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Sharon! What languages do you all do? I agree it's amazing how RS was able to become more accessible to way more people by lowering the price and tripling the features!! If you all do German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, or Polish by any chance lemme know, we can game sometime!!####$$##%POSITIVE
ITS GREAT THE PLATAFORM... ITS VERY EASY TO LEARN ANOTHER LENGUAGE...####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh and it is!!! I speak 5 languages and have taught 3, Rosetta stone is the BEST tool for language learning there is!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I might do the diploma after the a level with ou but it is very dear and a completely different method involved. The good thing about RS is their method. It really does work.####$$##%POSITIVE
However for a lot of people this is a life long/long term thing and having to renew every year is not good.  Much better for myself to have a product that I own but pay a subscription for parts (the current model) as opposed to the new way they're looking. Not everyone can be online, not everyone wants to be online all the time. If its an option then that's ok, but to remove the option of owning the product then I'd say whomever is making this decision really needs to give there head a shake. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just started Rosetta Stone French Course, its brilliant worth every penny.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got Spanish LA 3 weeks ago and I love it, I just finished Level 1 the other day and it was one of the best investments I ever made. When I get to level 4 or 5 I am going to get Brazilian Portuguese next.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the French level 1 and I loved it. If money didn't rule the world I'd have a chance at getting another one.####$$##%POSITIVE
this is very interesting because I paid 299 for a 6 mo online subscription for Italian, I would have gladly paid $240 for a whole year! I guess some pricing consistency is warranted ####$$##%NEGATIVE

Yes im impressed so far but sadly no qualification after all the hard work..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeh you're right, and qualifications can mean the difference between getting a Job and not, for example.  I mean, you get a certificate, but obviously it's not a recognised qualification, just a memento!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wasn't able to put Japanese and Korean under the same email.  When I talked to someone from RS they told me I couldn't.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks i may consider that!####$$##%POSITIVE
The fact that I don't need Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks everyone, I feel better and will give it another try.  I live in Michigan and my ancestors are from Finland, I have a brogue that I get teased about all the time, they say I sound like I am from Canada.  So when I was first practicing my Italian, I wasn't getting very good scores with the pronunciation, I thought it was my accent.  So I am not very confident in speaking to a native  Italian with a Michigan Finnish brogue!   I am determined to get over it and conquer this as I am going to Europe with my sister, we are going to England, France, Ireland and Italy.  I was hoping to be able to get to the French too.  We shall see!  Thanks everyone, I love Rosetta!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've worked my way up to finishing Level 3 over the last 6 months, and I'll tell you that feeling never goes away.  There are often learned more advanced than you, and often learners who feel you are more advanced than they are.  My recommendation, is take the opportunity to learn from every session.  It's intimidating at first, but after a few sessions you'll know enough to let the coach know when you don't understand and you'll build confidence.  I try to attend 3 to 5 studio sessions a week to keep practicing, and I think that works very well.  Good luck, and keep at it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Roberta don't give up, all the coaches are very patient, and the other learners are patient too! repeat the studios a few times, I do each studio at least 3 times, it's a learning experience. just make sure you know how to say "i don't know", "i don't understand" and "please, repeat" in the language you are learning :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am so drawn to it.  I can't let a day go by without doing one or two lessons and games.  But alas I'm away and can't take my desk top with me.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm worried about the same thing with Japanese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've felt the same way for sure! As a matter of fact, I was on level 3 when I got TOTALe and did my level 1 Unit 1 session - I was way over confident! I didn't do half as well as I thought I wound!  But, I learned a very valuable lesson that day: Studio really prepares you for real conversations outside of Rosetta Stone; it trains you to be confident when you speak to native speakers.  Its really amazing, actually.  You'll make less mistakes outside of Rosetta Stone because you've already made the mistakes in Studio - if that makes sense.  I hope it does...####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Roberta—I’ve taken every studio multiple times and I still get a few butterflies just before it starts.  The very first time I finally screwed up the courage to take a Level 5 studio, the other person announced that she is a French teacher!  I almost bailed too as she babbled away in French, but I stuck it out and learned a lot.  I even knew a word or two that she didn’t know because I had just reviewed the material.  The studios are for you to practice speaking and understanding. Everyone there has been where you are and no one is judging you.  Sometimes I am a little better than the others, other times they are better than I am, but the coaches do a terrific job of including everyone at their level.  I still have the occasional brain freeze---just the other day I couldn’t think of a single thing to ask about that guy cheating at golf….but it’s always okay and the studios are really a lot of fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
If not the whole course, then just level 5 so I can start from the beginning...a fresh start, so to speak!  :-)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Will see what happens. But I do now nothing from level 2 has ever showed up in the games####$$##%NEGATIVE
How do i reset it for the whole level?  Remove all the check marks?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Truthfully, if I had known it was going to be this difficult, I would have just bought and external drive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wait. It used to be $50 to upgrade when they told me on the phone that I couldn't but now that it seems we can it is way pricier!?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey Charlie.  The great thing about RS is it's self-paced. Whatever works for you is perfect for you!  I love that it's designed to be fun and intuitive...who needs something else in life that feels like a chore, eh?   I like Geoffrey's post-it suggestion.  My poor family gets all my questions in Spanish.  :-).  Whatever works! Enjoy!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your help guys :)####$$##%POSITIVE
wonder if they take payments####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry for repeating what Geoffrey said.  I was using my iphone and it hadn't refreshed.  Alexander, I found TOEFL guides with practice tests on Amazon for about $20.  Taking the practice test will give you a really good feel where you'd place on the actual test...and save you a lot of money.  Let me know if you don't have easy access to a guide book where you are and I may be able to help.  Best of luck!  And your English really is great!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Amy that is one of the languages I want to learn, it is a beautiful language and I already sent in 6 request to have them add it as one of their lanuages, I heard Romanian is the closes language to latin, and there is only a few schools in the US that teach it.####$$##%NEGATIVE

level 2 unit 2&3 LA Spanish have been the most difficult for me, but the lvl2 unit3 studio was one of the most fun...so there is a reward when you make it through!  hint: Caperucita Roja####$$##%POSITIVE
Super. Great to know. I can't wait to order tomorrow. Thx everyone for your feedback.####$$##%POSITIVE
My personal theory is that "the wall" is actually progress.  You are at a point where your awareness of the language is good enough to realize what you don't know.   My philosophy is to "Feel the burn", work through the wall.  You will look back on this wall period and realize it was actually a break through period. There are more walls but they all are similar.   You may also find that words pop into your head but you don't know what they mean.  If you share my experience you may realize that something reminded you of the word in your daily life.  You selected the right word for the experience but didn't quite know what it meant in your native language.####$$##%POSITIVE
First off take one day a week off of the intense study and watch a movie in your language... that's something that's really helped me... after every week I watch a movie in Mandarin.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree!! And thank you Sharon!! =D####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning languages does take time.  It takes less with Rosetta Stone but there is a need to spend consistent, day to day time on the project.   I also think that there is a limit to how much you can poor on for a single language in a day.  It may be that switching from one language to another allows you to do more language learning but you still need the time to do it for each.####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning Japanese with RS was much harder for me than learning Spanish or German.  It's a totally different ballgame.  And it is slower.  =)  I've studied multiple languages at once (not using RS) and it was very enjoyable.  But I was a full-time student.  If time is a factor for you, then you may experience really slow progress if you try to do two languages at once.  But if you have a decent amount of free time, you may really enjoy the growth.  Great success to you no matter which path you chose!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have also found that posting issues on the support.rosettastone.com site is a very good idea because it documents the problem.  I do think RS loses track of open issues when they are just phoned in.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I write that because in the same amount of time I got comfortable in 4 languages. It really, really works, so while it####$$##%POSITIVE
Is expensive, it is an investment####$$##%POSITIVE
Taylor: oh I know it will be a great investment! I just need to save up to buy it. :) ####$$##%POSITIVE
No they don't.  The question has come up often.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with you Alex, but I want to wait till I get to a certain level before I start a conversation with a native speaker, but I am starting to watch spanish soap operas now so once I get to around level 4, I will talk to a native speaker.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is pretty good. It really makes me want to get one of the 1-5 languages. It's just hard choosing which one. I want to use one I took classes in.  That's three different languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am in Level 5, Unit 4 of German.  It is great because it is individualized for the learner.  I already have about 8 courses in German at the university level.  Next year, I plan to visit cousins in Germany (my brother also works for a German company and has to go to Germany), so being able to speak and understand is more important than having German as a subject at the university.  The vocabulary is geared towards regular conversations and the speech recognition software continually helps with pronunciation.  I talk over Skype with native speakers (In Germany and Austria), and though I still have a problem speaking at the level I would like (it takes time to speak effortlessly), I can form sentences, understand what is being said, and can respond.  For me, that is the most important!! I bought RS Italian since a family member has a house in Ticino (Switzerland - the only Italian-speaking canton), and it is better than a class because I get to speak!!  Let us know how you do!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I will, Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone for your input. I cant wait to start tonight after work####$$##%POSITIVE
Monica, I'm very excited for you!  I think you'll be amazed how effective the program is.  Like Michele, I would highly encourage you to start studios as soon as you finish your first unit.  They are so helpful...I try to do each unit twice, just for reinforcement.  I also really enjoy the games.  The "bingo" game has someone reading a story while you have to find the words on a bingo card.  Oh.  My.  Heck!!!  The first time I did it, I just sat there...stunned.  But after that, I've found it's a really great way to attentively listen to someone speaking your learning language fluently.  Look forward to hearing how you come along in German!  Enjoy!####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait until my first Korean session.####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm so excited, i'm learning too and i'm just about to start mine####$$##%POSITIVE
@Everyone! Thanks so much! everybody has been so helpful and i truly appreciate all of ya'alls advice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Fadila, I hope you have a fabulous time learning your new language!  If you have any questions, this is a great place to ask.  People here are very knowledgeable and very supportive!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow!  Thank you so much!  I kept up pretty well for being totally in over my head!  =)  Rosetta Stone Rocks!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Заравствчйте Mary!  I'm learning Russian too :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hahahah. They need Rosetta Stone Southern American English for some cases. I wish I could master the Ulster dialect, but it's so hard.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wish i could buy Rosetta Stone Chinese :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!  I was pretty sure that was the case but I thought I would ask.  The Studio portion is the best.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great question Michelle because now that confirms the fact that, in the new year, I will get the online course for Greek instead of the CD set! I thought you had to resubscribe for the online features!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks alot :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Mike, I thought the same. I bought French levels 1-5 for £379 and completed all levels in 5 months and so could have bought the online access for just £199 instead.  Janice is also right as I've gone back from levels 2-5 to review and refresh my knowledge but I still could have done that in less than 6 months. But not having it on  there anymore would make me nervous and panic about booking the studio sessions!!!!....I am planning to learn Greek levels 1-3 using online access because it is a smaller course and I should be able to complete it all and review it in under 6 months.####$$##%POSITIVE
Just started level 2 Greek and still love it! And now I'm learning directions so I won't be lost this summer!! I love the studio sessions! I've had the same tutor 3 of 4 times and she is fabulous and 2 of 4 times have had the same other student so it's cool to see we're on the same track.####$$##%POSITIVE
I use the online but one advantage the CDs have is being able to take the program with you where there is no internet access.####$$##%POSITIVE
You will love it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone for the great feedback. I will be going with the 1-5 set.   Oh, by the way, I was on the fence with purchasing RS and was looking for reviews online. All the "independent" reviews were selling another product. Then I thought I'd check out facebook. It's hard to fake facebook interaction especially with this number of fans (which were quite a few - another reason which convinced me to purchase). Rosetta Stone, you might want to make your facebook page a little more visible on your website and your blog. I think it's a great tool for your business. Just a thought.####$$##%POSITIVE
One more thing, the free online demo is great! That was another huge factor in choosing RS. Although I'm going to get the Spanish Set, I tried the German demo just for giggles. I have ZERO knowledge of German and it's amazing how much you can internalize with this system in just a few minutes!####$$##%POSITIVE
The Studio sessions are GREAT!  Everyone is nervous the first time.  You will become addicted to them :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Harlene!  My first studio session was a total disaster.  But we all made it through just fine.  =)  Just to restate what Ashleigh said, there are 4 studio sessions per level...one after you complete each unit.  And you can "retake" studio sessions if you want...I do so for reinforcement and practice.  Good luck!  And enjoy!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it is a great thing, because after a few months, I forget some words I haven't used in a while.  I seem to still remember their meaning when I see or hear them, but start to lose the ability to rapidly recall them to use in a sentence.  It is really a good feature, but it is odd that I hadn't had much at all of it, and now it is every day!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am on level 2 on my RS Spanish, and I dont know how much it will help but I will try it for awhile a see what happens, as far as reading I am good, as far as making sentences, I am average, reatining it is sometimes a struggle, especially since there's not that many spanish people where I live and I cant afford skype, but I will not let discourage me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great to hear!  I'm studying Russian as well####$$##%POSITIVE
i love the unique feel to the language. where i live, if u go to any pizza place and start speaking russian, you'll get a x-large for 5 bucks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I surely will.####$$##%POSITIVE
At least keep up with the reviews, it's only a few minutes a day.####$$##%POSITIVE
You will enjoy it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone works with Tribal groups, providing them with their technology so they can use their language knowledge to create RS courses.  When the project is done, the tribe sells the language product and not RS.   So, I suggest you work with the Cherokee people and encourage them to join the RS program.   Here is a link to it: http://www.rosettastone.com/global/endangered####$$##%POSITIVE
Ohh, thank you very much for your asistance anyways####$$##%POSITIVE
Tom, at the bottom of this page  http://support.rosettastone.com/ics/support/KBResult.asp?searchFor=spanish  are a bunch of .pdf files.  Each one contains the vocabulary covered in that level (look at the last couple pages of the pdf, it's an alphabetical list).  It'll give you some idea of where you are.  However, I'm actually with Janice.  I have a minor in French and was fluent (20 years ago) at both the conversational and business level.  I just bought the whole set for three reasons.  First, it's a good refresher and RS is a system.  Second, you get 3 months free access to the online portion, which has some value.  Third, my family can use the program from the beginning.  Good luck!  I hope you enjoy your language journey!####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald you are doing great!####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald, I think it's a brilliant idea.  Celine Dion taught herself English by listening to American music.  And watching Spanish tv is that same "immersion" concept that RS is based on.  You can also set most DVD movies to play in Spanish.  You're a very dedicated learner...very motivating for someone like me!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
It is fabulous.  I started this week too.  If you haven't tried the online games, I *highly* recommend!!!!   The first time I played bingo, I didn't understand a word.  By the third or fourth game, I was really catching on.  Wishing you great success!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I will definitely do some games!! That sounds fun!!!!  I wish you great success as well :) And Thanks Ashleigh!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought RS German, and have almost finished Level 5, and it really works!  I bought it after taking 8 college classes in German, and it really took me to a new level.  The program has speech recognition, and is individualized.  The online portion is WELL worth the money because you get classes with native speakers, games in the new language, and stories.  I plan to go to Italian-speaking Italy next year, so I bought RS Italian.  I like that I can pace myself.  There are also focus lessons in vocabulary, grammar, proonunication, speaking, writing, etc.I bought RS Japanese so that I speak to some of my friends in their native language. I also want to be conversationally fluent in Russian and CHinese, and I will purchase RS for those. It works, it is fun, and the program gives you the confidence to speak the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Plain and simple: YES!!! Give it time, lots of time, but you'll get out of it what you put into it.  I'm learning Spanish myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am currently using them for Japanese and Korean.  I personally like what i got from them.  I cannot say how much you will learn altogether because I haven't finished mine yet. But from what i've done so far i've been able to retain what I've learned and I love the studio sessions with the coaches.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have used RS Japanese and RS Italian. So far, the learning of a foreign laguage was entertaining and fun. It didn't feel like a chore for me to learn a language. I started japanese earlier this year. After a few months I was able to carry conversations(not fluent). The best thing about RS is that I can learn at my own pace. I can play games in the mornings (with japanese natives) or nights(with fellow japanese learners). Studio sessions are very informative. My japanese studio coaches are wonderful and patient. They corrected me when I say the words incorrectly. I highly reccommend RS for language learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
After finishing the 5th level, you will have enough to be conversationally fluent, but remembering all the vocabulary and parts can be difficult!  Yes, I use outside sources such as speaking with native speakers, grammar books/dictionaries, reading on the internet or listening to YOUTUBE videos, and anything else that I can do to use the languages.  I value speaking and understanding over reading and writing (I can read and write any time, but really need to understand and respond right away).  When I start Japanese, I know that I will have to take a longer time because it is not a Romance or Germanic language, but the challenge is great!####$$##%POSITIVE
I bloody love it!!! I am just finishing French at the moment, just a few studios to complete, then I am done! I don't want it to end! I always have and always will recommend RS to anyone and truly believe it to be the most effective way of learning to be conversational in a language. I have so much faith in it that, after French, I'm going to do Spanish and then hopefully mandarin if I'm feeling brave! Go for it! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I love RS, I am currently learning Latin American Spanish, and I love it, it gets a little challenging at times but no one ever said learning a language is easy, after I finish with the spanish program, I am going to get Portuguese next, and maybe French depending on how I feel at that moment.####$$##%POSITIVE
Our family has RS for Spanish, French, German and Japanese.  There are several major advantages in my opinion.  You can go at your own pace.  The online features are great for reinforcement and variety.  The Studio sessions are like having a private tutor.  The program teaches with native speakers.  RS has also really developed a community of learners...there's support available for *you*!  Way cheaper, quicker, and more effective than a college course.  Oh, and there's a 6 month money back guarantee... just in case someone is unhappy with the course.  What more can you ask for?   ####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Spanish LA. I love it the program works well for me and it is fun. I look forward to getting on daily. Good Luck####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought RS German in April because I was frustrated with my German classes at the university.  It has helped me immensely with understanding and pronunciation.  I gained more confidence in speaking, and starting "speaking up" when around native speakers.  I learned and enjoyed it! I am almost finished with level 5, and wish there was more! I needed to learn Italian, so I bought RS Italian because it is cheaper than a class with books and transportation.  I bought RS Japanese to start in December because I have Japanese friends who have been encouraging me to take the language up again.  For learning a new language, RS is an economical way to actually get what you need - nuts and bolts, and I plan to use it for any language that I may need (If they offer it!)####$$##%POSITIVE
Tattle, I think the fact that the US government uses RS for training purposes speaks to the fact that it is effective and a good value.  I think it's important, though, to have a plan in place to use and refine your language once you've gone through the RS program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the input everyone!! Much appreciated!####$$##%POSITIVE
that is really cool####$$##%POSITIVE
Woah, awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
No, as I'm learning Spanish, but the content is the same which means, you'll learn quite a bit more.  There really isn't an end to language-learning so using 4 & 5 will allow for more depth in the language.  I hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
The English translation isn't very good - is this some special/secret organization that has to do with the occult?####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is soooo cool!!####$$##%POSITIVE
What is interesting to me is how people put forth so much effort to decipher something like this only to be "rewarded" by the nonsensical bs that got revealed and which might have been expected if one would have realistically thought about 18th century knowledge.  But, then again, the guys who did this decryption probably weren't motivated by expectations of finding sublime information, rather most likely it was the challenge of deciphering something that nobody else has been able to break until now.  I would second that motion to move on to the Voynich manuscript.  Also would be cool if somebody could decipher the Beale papers.####$$##%POSITIVE
This message in the Rosetta stone wasn't that exciting either but it led to being able to read hieroglyphics, a truly exciting discovery!####$$##%POSITIVE
Amazing, what a gift. The future applications sound very promising.####$$##%POSITIVE
The links provided an interesting read...  Kept me mildly entertained for about three hours, and I've added the Copiale Cipher to my digital collection of old crap.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think it would be too confusing but I think you should be ahead in one language before starting on the next.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had that same issue a few days bck.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah I did that, I also noticed in the lessons that some of the words are in blue, green, and red, that helps a little too, Thanks Britnie.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much, Muñequito  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't know if this will help but it solved my issue...  I have to use the same USB port/headphone combination every time.  I didn't realize this was important until my techie boss fixed the issue for me.  Apparently USB ports "imprint" with devices and get glitchy if you aren't consistent in your use.    Good luck.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
I always put it in the same one.  Then they keep having me take it out and change.####$$##%NEGATIVE
if u could offer finish it would be great! it is one of the most difficult languages to learn :)####$$##%POSITIVE
it is a pleasure for me to be one of the 150000 users arrond the word of this magic "Roseta stone" :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Donald - if you look at that link, you will see traces of French, and German.  If you heard it spoken, you would definitely get that feeling.  There was a period after Chaucer called "The Great Vowel Shift" (google for it) in which pronunciation shifted to its present form very quickly. How and why is much debated.  It's an interesting thing.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Jennifer, I am learning Italian.   I know what you mean, there is hardly ever anyone on to play with.  I was excited for Simbio italian night last week and no one showed up :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wonder why there is obviously nobody learning italian :D####$$##%NEGATIVE
You need to trust the system and complete it. I promise you it will start to make sense, just don't worry about it right now, just enjoy it! And remember, if you bought it from RS, if before 6 months you decide it's not for you, get your money back. Thousands of people use this system for all sorts of languages including very complicated ones, and they have success! This system really does work, give it a chance!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok, thanks. I just thought that this would be how the whole thing would turn out. I was getting frustrated, cause I'm going through the first couple of parts and it's been the same thing. But I'll test it out and see where it gets me. Thanks a lot bro (or girl)...####$$##%POSITIVE
Bro! Liam is an Irish name for William. You are welcome. Stick with it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hopefully in 9 months or so I can get a good understanding of the language.  My organization that I work for has an office in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  I know that it's going to take some work though. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Michael, I can totally relate.  When I used RS Japanese, not only did I not understand what they were saying, but I also was reading a bunch of symbols that meant nothing to me.  Very overwhelming.  Very frustrating.  Like Liam said, RS teaches like you learn your native language, by exposure, building little upon little.  I've found the best way to use this program is to ...  Breathe.  Believe.  And go with the flow. Liam was right, it does start coming together and making sense.    Now, I'll be honest with you.  I have a handy dandy Spanish-English dictionary.  It makes me happy.  It's not the RS way...but this is *my* language journey.    I would highly encourage you to play the solo game "mem-go" (I think that's what it's called, it's the memory matching game.)  It provides a lot of reassurance when first learning the vocabulary.  Also, make use of the studio sessions.  They are **wonderful**.  Everyone's equally clueless and the language coach will walk you through, helping you become more confident in your new language.  I wish you the best of luck!  The folks here on FB are very supportive and it's a great resource to ask questions.  Enjoy your language journey!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Portuguese and Spanish are the most closely related Romance languages and maybe i will learn it in the future :) :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the help guys, how do I do the studio session and games?  I just thought the program would be like this throughout the whole series. That's why I started getting overwhelmed and frustrated.####$$##%POSITIVE
I can relate too; though I took (and failed) a Spanish class, I was able to pick up on vocab in level 1 with generally no problem.  The key is to give it a lot of time; learning a language can take years! But its one of those "you get out of it what you put into it" things.  I am now on level 4, Unit 2.  From the start I wanted the program to be very strict on my pronunciation and now, when I speak to Latinos, they nearly always tell me I speak very well.  Also, as you progress you will find yourself getting stuck on concepts (usually grammar) but with time and practice, you're brain will get it suddenly and you'll go "OH! NOW I get it!!"  So, just stick with it and of course, you can always do as Tracie said, and also come here for support as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, David! I am learning Portuguese and I love it! I am currently in Level 3, Unit 2  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
No, it's cool. So, I have to sign up online to play the games and studio sessions?  @Matt OK, thanks a lot man. I guess what you put in is what you get out, and true, you can't master a language over night. Guess I just have to take it day by day.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wonderful!  I am almost finished with level 5 of German, and will return to review level 2 on when I finish.####$$##%POSITIVE
if you were to do an immersion class it would be the same way--it is the very best way to learn a language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck.  I may be getting it the beginning of next year.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a great language.  I've really enjoyed learning it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Aaron!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the support! Means a lot####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm currently learning Japanese too.  It would be cool to have more people to practice with whenever we can.  It can get kinda lonely on here without any.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I absolutely love Japanese! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
And i would love to have more friends that are learning Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks :) :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
i gotta try this!!####$$##%POSITIVE
When you can think in a foreign language, the language is no longer foreign.####$$##%POSITIVE

Cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone , I am on the first level in the first module where it wants me to learn the words for 'boy, girl, man, woman, tea, milk, water". I grew up completely  bi fluent in tagalog and english. I am familiar with basic turkish. The way it teaches turkish (which is an aglunative language like Tagalog) is kind of confusing. I've leared more useable real life turkish by forcing myself to speak in turkish with a turkish friend. I guess its neat for kids to learn 'boy, girl, man, woman, tea, milk, water' .... but as an adult I want to learn "How are you?" before "boy,girl, man, woman". 15 minutes into Rosetta Stone I already knew 'how are you' from my own learning , never hearing "how are you?" once 15 minutes into Rosetta Stone. I am not going to give up on it but I've honestly seen nothing but 5 star reviews on the Rosetta Stone website for its own software and lots of  1 star reviews on amazon.com  :-/####$$##%NEGATIVE
to bad it costs so much, X-mas present?-LOL####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wise choice (to start anew). ¡Buena suerte, Donald!####$$##%POSITIVE
Never mind.. read up and basically if you don't buy it from Rosetta Stone themselves then it's 99.986384% a counterfeit copy!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Shayne, not exactly.  Rosetta Stone has legitimate retailers they authorize. Barnes and Noble and Amazon for example.   Their no questions asked return policy is only available from them.  In answer to your first question, all Rosetta Stone courses work the same way, introduce the same concepts in the language being taught in the same order.  So, what you hear for one course is true for all the rest.  It is worth the money, generally the conversational proficiency you can expect is similar to multiple semesters in college except you learn at your own pace and, I think, with less hours of effort.   Totally worth it.  Less expensive courses, in my experience "Don't work", you will end up giving up before you achieve any proficiency.  Though cheaper, they are a complete waste of what you did spend, in my experience.   Finally, RS has that return policy.  Prove this to yourself or get your money back.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm interested in the same languages.  I might go the online way for my next language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Russian, i just like to learn languages and be able to communicate with other people, Learning a new language opens your mind.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes!  Thank you!  That worked!####$$##%POSITIVE
Andrew, I hope you have a fabulous time learning your new languages.  I have used RS for German and made incredible progress.  I'm totally sold on the RS method!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much, but it hard to count on it and may have the same words.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Milady Rosetta Stone covers all the situations that you encounter in everyday life including how to ask someone what the word for a thing is in their language.   Another thing to consider is that vocabulary is not the best test of a language course.   If it were, you could buy a dictionary and memorize it.  What is just as important is the context of the words and the structure of sentences, pronunciation, hearing different voices.   Even more important is finding the right thing in a particular context.  At this Rosetta Stone is outstanding and really better than others.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Dennis, what language are you learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks you, James and Geoffrey.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do you have TOTALe?  If you have v3, its not available.  If you look at the lesson list within a unit the last thing says "Rosetta Studio", that is the studio.  It is not two way video.   It is also not available until you complete the lessons and exercises in that unit.####$$##%POSITIVE
If you go to the RS web site, you can upgrade it for (I think) about $50.00 which gives you 3 months of Studio.  They can also give you instructions for copying your progress file to the new computer.  I suggest you do this before installing the upgrade.  The RS support people can help you with that. (the answer depends on what operating system you use).####$$##%POSITIVE
You lucky, I dont have any spanish friends accept for some here on FB, reading the stories helps build my confidence a little bit more but it would be nice to have some close by friends that could help too, I find that latin american spanish is more simple than spain spanish, I cant wait to get deeper into the spanish so I can learn portuguese next.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the product but am confused as to how words can mean different things when used in different positions in a sentence####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks. Is there any sort of payment plan offered if I was to get a 5 level set? It may be tough to pay all that at once####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had a similar problem running RS on Windows XP.  I was ready to throw my laptop in the rubbish :-)   Tech support helped me to adjust the microphone volume using the XP Control Panel before starting RS.  For some reason Windows would reset the microphone volume to a very low level.  Not sure if this will help you but maybe tech support can help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!   I will definitely give it a shot!####$$##%POSITIVE
Speaking as somebody initially raised in a monolingual household, I think its a great idea.  I got into Spanish 11 years ago (8th grade), and I am taking Russian and Portugese through Rosetta Stone.  Incidentally, I'm also a 1/4 Polish :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your advice!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok! That sounds great! Thanks a lot! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you guys. appreciate it####$$##%POSITIVE
Have you tried the studio coaches?   They are familiar with the course and have been vetted for correct accents.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh thank you so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I switched to Extended early on, and I am pleased with it. There is a bit of repetition that takes place, but, the way I see it, I could use all the practice that I can get.####$$##%POSITIVE
Love it! I am in Level 5 Unit 3, and it has helped me a great deal with my German.  The studios are excellent and a great way to actually use the language.  I had 8 college courses in German before I started RS, and now can understand more and have more confidence because it is individualized - unlike the college classes.  Enjoy it!

i'll be very gratefull if u send the msg.....thank you mr.Aaron it's a beautiful cd...have a nice day####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm a Greek learner, I love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh definitely, it will be great. But my accent is better than LL Cool J's.   If you have "On Demand" or some way to watch prior episodes, watch the one that first aired tonight.  His character is supposed to be a Navy Seal that Speaks Arabic.   In this episode, he pretends to be a Libyan to help the freedom fighters ... you will laugh when he speaks.   Oh, one Libyan is played by an Italian ... what?####$$##%POSITIVE
Excellent, appreciate it:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi all, after two email follow ups and a phone call, Rosetta clearly care greatly about their customers and were very enthusiastic to help me to find a solution.  10/10 and Fair Play  to Rosetta Stone for turning it around :)####$$##%POSITIVE
www.sharedtalk.com is a RS website where you can get penpals and SKYPE pals.  There are also other websites where you can make friends with people in Spanish-speaking countries.  For most, you write or speak Spanish to them, and then write or speak English to you.  It is more of a language exchange.####$$##%POSITIVE
I went to game night last time and there still wasn't any other people. :( I guess Farsi isn't a popular language to learn. I will try again this time####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love her! just had her for L3U1####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much for your respond!So you wouldn't send disks to Russia anyway?####$$##%POSITIVE
I'd have failed badly!####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you once again!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have to say "Wow" again, In the end it was worth the wait. I didn't give up and finally got to a team member named Sakina. She has been so helpful. I cannot thank her enough. Not only did she walk me through a very difficult situation, she put up with my very bad attitude. And yes, I am ashamed of myself! LOl She should be promoted. It would have been helpful for me to know that I only had to add a level instead of reinstalling the entire thing. Sure messed things up for a bit but all is well now. And off and learning I go!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Shanice for taking the time. The problems have been resolved. I think the world of Rosetta Stone again!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I would suggest you put this on the web page somewhere that the headset doesn't come with the online subscription.  If it's there, I certainly didn't see it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am not upset about it other than I can't use my Rosetta Stone until I go to the store which probably won't be for a couple of days (we live in a very rural area and the store is not close).####$$##%NEGATIVE
I bought a headset at Best Buy and it doesn't work.  It is a Logitech H530 USB.  I have to repeat the word 5-10 times before Rosetta Stone hears me (I know I am saying it right because this is only a refresher for me).####$$##%NEGATIVE
level one...taking my time:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Adiv:  Todos los días y en todo lo que estoy haciendo más fluido gracias a Rosetta Stone español (América Latina).####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Beauty Proof 100%, Adiv, Donald, and Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
For some reason I couldn't find Rosetta Stone in the Mac App Store. Hints on a search?####$$##%NEGATIVE
You are so lucky that you will be able to practice what you will be rapidly learning using Rosetta Stone. I recieved my 1st level for my birthday in August and it's amazing. I have no one to practice with and I think that hinders my progess just a bit. I can listen or read and understand with no problem but still can barely prounouce Oui correctly. LOL Good luck to you. You're gonna love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!  I will and I do have to say that the native speaker was so gracious and made me feel better than I actually am!  I am looking forward to doing more and will be buying more when mine run out!  I LOVE ROSSETTA!####$$##%POSITIVE
@RS-Thanks - I was trying to find this link!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank You!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE BUT CAN'T AFFORD THE $500.00 DOLLARS FOR THE PROGRAM IT'S WAY TO EXPENSIVE FOR ME####$$##%NEGATIVE
THAT'S AWSOME I NEVER KNEW THAT ONCE MY DAUGHTER AN I ARE FEELING BETTER I WILL LOOK INTO IT I WANT TO LEARN TO SPEAK MY DAUGHTER'S LANGUAGE BUT NOONE TEACHE'S YOU TO SPEAK CREOLE CLOSEST I CAN GET I GUESS WOULD BE PORTGUESE####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait to finish Rosetta Stone, I'm very proud of my German heritage and I really want to visit a few places there. Bad Tolz, Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin :P I also want to see all of the concentration camps, I'm very interested in going to Germany####$$##%POSITIVE
i dont have the money to upgrade :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
hi i have tried your link but it will not go through.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's free!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta I will try to finish all levels before going there anyways is that service free !?####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you James! The reason of my interest towards Danish language is that I have Danish heritage, so my grandparents used to speak in Danish but I never had a clue on it! Now I want to learn the language. However, I'm really looking forward to learn as many languages as I can!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just watched all of the Rosetta Stone commercials, very cool :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm at Level 3, Unit 3.  I took Studio faithfully through Level 2 (June-August).   The Studio people also have a set of slides for us to cover, and would correct my grammar when I'd say it wrong, but they never explained WHY it was wrong or WHY the other thing was right.  Again, I was left guessing. There is no real opportunity to ask questions or receive explanations in Studio, which is what I need.  I don't think I'll pay to extend Studio through level 5.  Although the practice is helpful, It's just not worth it to me to pay more and still not get answers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ah I see :) ...wow you guys are quick! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
These are great !! I hope I don't choke when I take a trip to Latin America next year.####$$##%POSITIVE
Only someone who has tried to learn another language can appreciate this situation..... I would be scared to death too! (this video made me smile) = )####$$##%POSITIVE
Great commercial! It's hard to transition from the classroom/visual/everything-is-written to retrieving those words and phrases out of your own brain any time, any place. I'm glad RS is exploring this avenue.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yea. Thanks. I didn't see it in the mall kiosks. So cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
This is great and so cute! Love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Great commercial. I've been there with Spanish and still do as an interpreter in training####$$##%POSITIVE
am getting to know more, that i used 2, :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Just went through the second part of the first part...whatever that is...MUCH harder than the first part of the first part!!  I am really looking forward to getting into it...I think I am going to learn a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks alot Krissy... i did not know i had that application. We are looking in to getting an i pad and once we do i know it will make our life learning a laguage easyer. Thanks to everyone wlse as well. I appreciate it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christine.  I found I really started to get the idea of it all around level one unit three.  My wife and I were away for our anniversary and walking around a book store.  As I was looking at a book I saw a woman and her daughter walking by and overheard a portion of their conversation which was in spanish.  I heard the one lady say "el libro cuesta treinta-neuve dolares y.... " and they continued walking.  The point is that I picked it up and understood it.  This has happened a few times and each time I got really excited about it.  Now at work, i make all my passwords as spanish sentences, and write emails to friends in both spanish and english.  What I can anyway.  :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Christine!  It took me until near the end of level two when something clicked and Spanish seemed more natural.  It happened while working on a story about Little Red Riding Hood in the Studio session at level two unit three.  All of a sudden the past and future tense verbs finally made sense.   I hope things click earlier for you as it does for many, but if it doesn't hang in there!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
When I downloaded the Italian, some was familiar because I used to speak it rather well years ago (and spent time in Venice), and some because of French and Spanish.  I still have 2 more units in German to complete before I finish the 5 levels.  I would love to do something different - like Russian or Chinese (now that there are 5 levels), and want to start in the new year.  I really should go for Portuguese - then I will have all four major Romance languages. And James, you should go for French for the same reason!! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Excellent point Geoffrey!####$$##%POSITIVE
WOW!  I just finished Level 2.  What do you plan on doing to keep up your skills?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! :D I'm planning to learn Japanese first ! ^_^####$$##%POSITIVE
O_O Waaaaaaaaaaaaa. So cool! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Wooooohooooo!  Major congrats on that huge accomplishment.  Now for the vacation to celebrate!  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Sounds dodgy to me!####$$##%NEGATIVE
don't!! i was ripped off big time and regret it 100%. the whole deal, with no activation. it was a little suspicious that it came from mihang####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just got French on Wednesday. I love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've just finished French and it was brilliant! Great language to learn. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Good.  I am very comfortable with the ones that I have been working with :) :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
me too, love the LA Spanish coaches!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am taking the Hebrew course now, and I can't believe how quickly my skill in the language is growing - and without really feeling like I'm trying! Somehow Rosetta Stone seems to replicate the smooth and natural experience that we had as children learning our first language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I felt that way with the Japanese course. I don't feel as pressured to learn but I still learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Mad at Rosetta for discontinuing the contract with the US Army####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have the code but the error is that it was installed on another computer wich it's not true. I deactivated the italian rs old version and bought totale...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Moment, are you saying that i bought something illegally? Don't need to do that. In the airport. Goodbye####$$##%NEGATIVE
You can transfer.  You can call tech support for help, or just put it on the new computer as RS lets you place it on two computers. Personally, I would make sure that it is off of the old computer, especially if you do not plan to use it with RS again.####$$##%POSITIVE
My problem is that i dont understand this for example:  De auto is geel. (een gele auto) Het ei is geel. (een geel ei.)  How am i supposed to know when to use the words "blauwe, gele, witte, rode" i know what they mean but i dont understand when im supposed to use them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
In my mind, this is the main flaw in the Rosetta Stone program.  Too much "learn from exposure" and no explicit grammar points.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay thanks everyone####$$##%POSITIVE
oh, wait! yay, i just didn't install level one and am starting from level 2. still, i get unit 1 review :D####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah cause I had Spansih(Spain) and I got up to level 2 unit 1 before I decided to trade it in for LA Spanish, It seems like I might be trying to take to much in, especially with the simple past and imperfect past tenses and I havent even got to the future tense yet, and I try to make sentences by myself using these but it takes me a little longer now to make a sentence than before, and before I move on any further I want to make sure that I have this down packed.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Donald.  I had the same thought.  But all the stuff I'd forgotten came up in the next segment or two for reinforcement.  And I'm pretty sure you've already hit the future.  Hoy voy a ir a la universidad con mi hijo.  Same construct as English.  I am playing more games so that I get that reinforcement, but I bet you're doing really well.  It was a huge dump in those couple units.  Shook my confidence too.  Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
OK to take a break!   Level 2 really is the most difficult new material, at least for LA Spanish.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow, I thought I was the only one who felt this way about Level 2. Level 1 was so easy and now I really have to concentrate on Level 2. Right now I'm on Level 2 Unit 2 for Japanese. It's getting more complex now. But, in due time I think we all get to that point where we might feel a little stuck. But, we just gotta keep going with the program.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You learn that in studio! Especially by the time you get to level 3 and start to have the ability to discuss more abstract concepts. The linguistic ability also frees you up to learn more outside of RS. Personally, I wish they had some more culture-specific material in their pedagogy rather than "Little Red Riding Hood," in every language, but I understand that the point of that is to make sure you have all the linguistic tools to effectively recount a relatively complex story...which 99% of their customer base will be familiar with, so you're not compounding learning another language with cultural differences.####$$##%POSITIVE
Some of the TOTALe stories will help with that.   In my experience visiting other countries, people know that you are not from their culture and don't think of mistakes as rude.   The Internet is more helpful than some prepared thing could ever be.  I visited an Iraqi restaurant recently and they had Arabic popular music playing .. because of surfing the internet looking for language samples to practice with, I knew who the stars were.  Fairouz and Nancy Ajram by the way.####$$##%POSITIVE
as soon i get my full totale access, i'd love to! I love the language!!!! Я люблю Россия и Руский!####$$##%POSITIVE
When you have produced Finnish, Norwegian, Romanian, Serbian, Amazigh, Hawaiian and a few others that I sadly forgot well, shucks lets get Elvish, Klingon, and Parsel Tongue.   I take language learning seriously.  It's enjoyable but I feel these requests trivialize the effort and the inquiry into other cultures that involve living human beings.   As for imagination, what someone gets from a real world language in terms of stimulating the imagination goes far beyond anything in an series of books.  That's just my opinion but it is why your products are worth the price.####$$##%POSITIVE
lol, J.R.R is more Impressive then I thought!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool, which English are you learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
good job! english is a very hard language. good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you! Charlie good luck to you####$$##%POSITIVE
He means the British version of English OR the American version,  Jonathan.  Congratulations, I hear it is very hard to learn English.  I learned it as a child and still suck at it!  :-)  I am learning Italian and I'm having so much fun with it!####$$##%POSITIVE
i have american version... is so  amazing####$$##%POSITIVE
That's good to know that the program is amazing.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love hearing someone talk with a British accent. I really hope I can start learning your native language next year.####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald, this really isn't a reflection of your learning.  It was too much to introduce all at once.  On a silly note, every time I say trabajaba, I giggle and think of Fred Flintstone!  Good luck.  I'm really there with ya on this one.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Sharon####$$##%POSITIVE
The more you listen to and speak with native speakers, the more you will learn this stuff.  Are you here in the United States?  I suggest you watch Univision and Galavision on satellite or cable, especially the soap operas.  Latin Americans LOVE their soap operas so there are plenty to chose from :) :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Donald, I chose to get a Spanish instructor to explain the difference to me.  Quite helpful. RS =great tool, but all tools have their limitations.####$$##%POSITIVE
I wish I knew one Mark, but Its ok I will eventually figure it out, most of the guys here live in a area where there is a considerable amount of native spanish speakers, I unfortunately dont live in such a area.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This also helped me. Scroll down to preterit/imperfect....http://www.studyspanish.com/tutorial.htm####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks ####$$##%POSITIVE
Both of my children (ages 12 and 9) are studying Latin and French.  They are home-schooled with a Jesuit/Catholic curriculum and the Latin is a requirement from 4th grade on.  It is *so* much easier to learn languages at a younger age.  My husband also had Latin in high school (also a Jesuit school) and he said that Latin helped him tremendously in English as well as it being the base for French, Spanish and Italian.  I had 4 years of high school Spanish (in San Diego no less) and learned NADA.  Spent a year in Paris in college...still nothing.  Rosetta has all of us speaking French around the house in about a week! I love this program!####$$##%POSITIVE
Would you like to learn hungarian? You don't need Rosetta Stone for this action! If you want to know how to say "Gyere Gyuri Győrbe, győri gyufagyárba, gyufát gyújtogatni", just use the Internet! Or - and this is the simpler solution - write to me and exchange our knowledge! :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you all! Rosetta Stone replied to me: 'Your issue has been escalated to appropriate department,they will be contacting you with in a short period of time.Please wait for our team to contact you.For any further updates please refer to this ticket number :14006-2100012.'####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, Shanice - please put in the request.   I've contacted Rick Black directly on multiple occasions.  I am baffled that anyone in the end stage of using your product would ever put the synching feature out to the public in its current form.    The instructional quality of RS is outstanding and more than makes up for the problems but the software quality is not to the same standard.  I've been patient, most problems which I have complained about (and which I have logged) are not fixed.   The synch delay is just awful.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Odd.  I don't see it for LA.  If I choose other languages, including Spanish Spain and scroll down, I am able to select other options but not for Spanish LA.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I see it, too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well that's too bad, but exciting! Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just looked that the Russian demo (Russian is on my short list for my next language) and it didn't seem too bad :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree. I don't believe the spelling would be hard, it's definitely the sounding out for me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Russian will be my next language.  I am starting to meet people who speak Russian and Polish, so I can talk to people.  Personally, I think that it is important to speak with people in the new language - it helps to reinforce and becomes more than just something you are learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
its actually really really hard, at first.  but once you get into it and master the alphabet it gets easier. busuu.com has free beginner lessons to supplement the rosetta stone russian pack####$$##%POSITIVE
This was my third time doing Unit 1. I try to do it once a week and honestly I felt like today was my best time :) I am really understanding more then I thought I would and to think its only been 1 month.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wonderful!  I got that the root verb was related but I wasn't quite sure exactly what was being presented (laugh and smile look pretty similar in still photos).  You are most wonderful and appreciated as always Miss Simy.  =)  Thank you very much!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I thought Level 5 only brought you up to B2. If that is the case, he would be better off doing RWorld or SharedTalk.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great idea!  I changed my GPS to German and I let it talk to me all the time :)####$$##%POSITIVE
What I like about changing the language on Facebook is that it offers to translate many posts.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a frustrating and overwhelming level/couple units, it's not just you.  There is a really good prospero game model where you get to practice the tenses.  Good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well can't say I'm looking forward to finishing level 2, unit 1 anytime soon then. lol.   Ahh well..  Vaya hasta!  :D     And as mentioned, prospero is a great game for putting together sentence structure.  One of my favorites actually.####$$##%POSITIVE
My husbands japanese is fluent as he was raised there he is bilingual. My inlaws speak only japanese our son can converse with them in japanese on the phone. Its an amazing gift . I wish rosetta stone would make a set for toddlers and little kids he likes the original and learns from it but it would be nice to have something geared towards little ones####$$##%POSITIVE
My three daughters, ages 9 and 5, are using Rosetta Stone to learn Portuguese.  They are progressing...    They are also learning Spanish in a language immersion school.    I'm multilingual as well so I can help them, but RS is a great language tool for anyone.  I highly recommend it!####$$##%POSITIVE
If you get the online version instead of the disks you get the studio along with it as long as you keep the monthly subscription.  It is a package deal :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Or pay I think its $150.00 to extend your subscription with the cd's for 15 months.  much cheaper than the 20/month.####$$##%POSITIVE
Love Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have decided regardless of how "incompetent" I feel the Studios really help me understand how to put the words together.  I am still in Level 2; however, I refuse to give up.  I love Rosetta Stone too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't buy too much. I bought RS when it was more expensive and you got 15 months of online service. I finished the 5 levels in 6 months and I still have more than 6 months of online.  I take studios several times a week to practice speaking, but even though the coaches are wonderful, the same topics over and over are getting a little boring as are the games. I've never seen anyone in Simbio (French) so that's not an option. For some reason they won't let you join the other free and more advanced site (there was a link to it here a few weeks ago) in your learning language as long as you have a RS subscription.####$$##%POSITIVE
I Love Rosetta Stone####$$##%POSITIVE
Just delete it and download it again. The same thing happened to me and that seemed to fix it.####$$##%POSITIVE
k thnx much....####$$##%POSITIVE
I got confused about this at first too.  There are 4 units per level...so 4 different studios per level.  And you can repeat the same studio more than once if you like.   Studios are really wonderful opportunties to practice and gain confidence.  I hope you're enjoying your new language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't let the studios scare you!! They are fun and really help you speak the language.  Take as many as you want/need!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been scheduling my studio sessions a couple of days after I finish a unit.  That way I can practice before hand.  They are really great too. They are a must to learn the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
As soon as a finish a unit I schedule a Studio.  I also do each Studio twice.  It is amazing how much better I do the second time around.  It is also great if I get a different teacher because each person puts their own spin on things :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I totally agree with Michele.  The "repeat" studio session really leaves me feeling like I'm making great progress.   And it's interesting to me, also, each teacher has a different accent/speaking style.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, ok... I entered so I  guess that answers my question, thank you for all of your help. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't comment specifically on Hindi, but to me, RS has huge positives for learning any language.  It's designed for you to learn at your own pace.  Sometimes I pick up quickly...sometimes I redo lessons.  But I learn, no pressure, no stress.  The online components are great for confidence-building, reinforcement and fun.  And the program is designed to be intuitive.  Go with the flow and enjoy learning a new language.  :-).  And the safety net...if you're unhappy, you have a 6 month guarantee.  Make sure to buy directly from RS for the guarantee.  Good luck.  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes - you should.   Also notice that they offer a six months no questions asked return policy.   Find out for yourself.   If you spend a few hours a week, preferably at least 1/2 hour a day, you will learn.  Slow or fast doesn't matter, it will be enjoyable and you will get there.####$$##%POSITIVE
You'll be very surprised how quickly you'll learn with RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
i love rosetta stone, recommend it to everyone i know :) including my mummy :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!!! I will check your service again.####$$##%POSITIVE
Lorraine it was me who got 2nd. Sent my declaration in Friday and got confirmation they received it yesterday. I am so thankful to rosetta stone for giving me this blessing towards my wedding. I really wanted tamieka to get a prize too, her story was great. ####$$##%POSITIVE
2 years ago, I paid a little over $500 for German levels 1 & 2.   The prices have dropped considerably.  2 years ago, there was no opportunity to purchase the supplementary online access with all the additional opportunities it provides.  My German boss, who's a VP at an international software corporation was very pleased with my German language acquisition through Rosetta Stone.  Although he did have a cow that the German verb for "love" was used for animals. Apparently old school Germans only say "I love you" to their significant other.  He didn't even use it for his mom or children.  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think that the price for the online subscription is extremely reasonable. Language tutors are much more expensive.  Also, RS doesn't do translation, so when I speak with German-speaking people I try to say what I want without thinking about what it means in English.  RS isn't perfect, but try a class at the university and see how much you pay and how much you DON'T get out of it.####$$##%POSITIVE
The Studio sessions are essential (in my opinion).####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think it is over the top and it is fully consistent with the cost of comparable amounts of language learning.  You paid for the CD's which are yours to use for life.  The Studio component is the subscription part, it is well worth it in addition to what you already paid for.   I think when you see how much you learn and start looking at alternative ways of learning, you will feel you got a very good deal.   By breaking this into two pieces which you can use or not as you like, it also makes the cost more manageable.  Take a college language course and take a break for a couple of weeks of classes, get sick, or don't have time to keep up with the exercises and see how much it costs.####$$##%POSITIVE
If you compare it to the price of formal classes,  definitely####$$##%POSITIVE
Fluency is a long journey, and this software will take you quite far. Most of it is situational, but you can apply the words to anything.####$$##%POSITIVE
WOW another farsi learner :) I am on Level 2 Unit 1.  Would love to play games sometime (there is never anybody online for Farsi)  good luck.  I am sure the alphabet helped, I didn't start really learning alphabet till after I finished Level 1 and it made a huge difference for me.####$$##%POSITIVE
hey nice! I had arabic for months and i still can't read it or understand much, i guess i have to be patient though####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm not sure about *always* but sure seems like it with LA Spanish, French and German.  And very cool that RS is such a handy tool for you!  =)  Have fun with Japanese!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that RS is good for the nuts and bolts, but if you need extra resources - dictionaries, grammar books, etc., I think that you should use them.  It is your course, after all.  I bought Japanese, and I know that I am going to use other resources to supplement.  It is just that RS is cheaper and more convenient than taking a class at the university (and not grade pressure!!)####$$##%POSITIVE
I really like RS, but you can't depend on it solely. As with any language software or class you have to do independent research. I'm using Rosetta Stone for Portuguese (which I have no prior knowledge of the language) and I use my Portuguese to English dictionary.   There isn't any course or program that you can use solely and know the language. It's simply impossible.####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS is an excellent program and you will get a lot out of it if you use the support system that they provide. I do th estudio session and activities. I participate in game night both duo and simbio. I also have a community that I am emmersed in...you have to put what you are learning into practice sooner than later. I also have some other resources that I am beginning to use that I had for years that were not working on their own.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hm... I'm also interested if this goal is doable with RS. Good luck. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
The five RS levels of French will put you at a comfortable B1.   B2 is achievable by supplementing as Taylor and others pointed out.  Most of the negative reviews I've seen online have been from people with competitive offerings.   Also, many of the reviews are outdated, not taking into account the value of the RS v4 online coaching.####$$##%POSITIVE
To be clear, I actually did so without using studio...I got studio shortly after passing the B2. This was almost 2 years ago, when studio was brand new. I highly recommend using as much studio as possible.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's the sprit :) bud####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok seems resolved - rant over- many thanks to Erik.####$$##%POSITIVE
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS really picked up the pace in its newer versions.  I have a decent background in several romance languages and found the level of information presented early/mid level 2 to be overwhelming.  I'm seeing other people say the same thing at the same point, which tells me that it's probably more of a software design issue than a user issue.  Sure, we have the option of repeating...but a program like RS needs to give me the illusion that I'm making progress (i.e. moving forward instead of having to repeat the same module(s) over and over) in order for me to maintain motivation and to view RS as effective.  If oodles of users are struggling at the same point in the program, then it's a program design issue.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I'm also learning Korean.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm still in the first level. I like it and I do feel like I'm learning. I'll be thinking the same in about 6 months.####$$##%POSITIVE
You must be burnt####$$##%NEGATIVE
He has called many times and it will not fix!  He is asking for cds and they are saying they are not available!  I have sent the email to him, but he is very frustrated about how he is being treated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I started Korean 2 days ago and i''ve already learned so much. You def won't regret it. It's actually really easy and so much more fun than i thought it'd be. I spent 5 hours studying today and didn't even sense the time flying by. Happy speaking, friend.####$$##%POSITIVE
I was taking Japanese with them. I loved it but I'm switching to the online version so I can't do it at the moment.####$$##%POSITIVE
Started mine friday <3####$$##%POSITIVE
just got through. it seemed as if i had forgotten everything that I had learned and was VERY nervous! however, Julia was very nice, warm, welcoming, and understanding. it makes me want to work harder and keep going strong! if Julia can hear, THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH and I hope to have you as an instructor again!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the Studio sessions :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
italiano! :) i've been wanting to learn for awhile now, i saw the information , and i believe now is the time to start!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wes, if you click the Rosetta Stone Store here on fb, they appear to still be offering $100 off a set of lvl 1-5.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks! i appreciate it! will do####$$##%POSITIVE
workbooks don't...work.####$$##%NEGATIVE
well if its a review that rosetta stone will post, I DID GREAT! If I did horrible, you'll never see it except on amazon.com! LOL####$$##%POSITIVE
1400..... I'm in the group of teens and I'm not english speaker####$$##%NEGATIVE
horrible. i can't even pass this test####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love both of those languages. I started taking Japanese years ago in college. I first started liking Japanese because I thought Japan had a really pretty culture and the language is pretty too. I still like the culture a lot, music, entertainment, clothing. I'm planning to move to either Japan or Korea for a job. I want to be able to speak to the people there.####$$##%POSITIVE
1040. :( Bad, bad, bad.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I failed and English is my first language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
well that made me feel like a complete moron...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got a 2260.  Native speaker here.  It's not easy to get.  Shocked that an American teen would get any correct, but love surprises.####$$##%NEGATIVE
2760, but I was having trouble reading without my glasses...####$$##%NEGATIVE
OK I'll try this but it's very odd as it has worked fine up till now. I dont think it's a firewall issue. The clocks have just gone back in the UK so that could be it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Finally, inserting and removing CD's is inefficient - children scratch these, there's wear and tear associated with inserting and removing the disks plus there's always the possibility of the disks getting lost when children are using them. NO MORE DISKS PLEASE!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow..thanks again Rosetta stone... it was very useful####$$##%POSITIVE
Finally, we got Eric and he helped us......It is up and running again!! What a nightmare!  :(####$$##%POSITIVE
I got 3440. I feel that studying as many languages as I have over the years helped me on the test.####$$##%POSITIVE
soo bad!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the replies. Strange why its illegal to resell it as there`s 100`s on ebay and other sites? So why haven`t you stopped these auctions?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Is English one of the hardest languages to learn? I'm a native english speaker just wanting to ask that question.####$$##%NEGATIVE
3600 for me. I'm 40 so happy with my result.####$$##%POSITIVE
Bobby - I would say that, just like learning other languages for us, it depends on the speaker's native language, and any other languages they already know. - Just like Spanish is easier for us to learn than say Chinese or Arabic :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I did well. I got a 2920 as my score.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Simy.  I'm thinking this is a cut and paste from now on.  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
well said.....####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Donald!  Most people, however, who criticize RS haven't even tried it, know nothing about it, and can't say why it "sucks", so this may not even register with them.  To add to #5 - the payment plan is interest-free!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks, got the full online package - hope by next month will be able to communicate/####$$##%POSITIVE
I am using Rosetta Stone Arabic and while I think there are some improvements that could be made it is overall a very good program####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Ken you right, just like everything thats man made its going to have its flaws,  I like RS, even though it forces me to figure things out, especially on this unit, I am taking a break today from it.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Alexander, will surely do.####$$##%POSITIVE
Can honestly say never had a problem with the support. I have found them to be pro-active in contacting me if somehow a session didn't go well, etc. Once, I said I could not play games bc no one was in the games area when I was so they set up a time for me to play the games with support Rosetta.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm referring to the tech support.  The people are courteous but one person can never really solve the problem. I always have to be transferred to someone at a higher level. That translates into getting put on hold into eternity. So you have to go on with your life and try calling them back when you have another hour of time to kill. If you ever have their software installed on a computer that crashes you'll understand where I'm coming from. One of your licenses to use the product is gone because the license is installed on the hard drive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't know something tells me that RosettaStone is discriminating applicants by where they came from. The reason why I'm suspecting this is my job application has automatically been disqualified just because I'm not eligible for work in the U.S.. Although I spent awful lot of time putting all the information in the application, it never even went through the consideration at the HR department at RosettaStone. My valuable time just has wasted with great in vain. I believe you might think it is natural that any applicant from outside of U.S. are not applicable. But I've seen lots of places are hiring people no matter where they are from, even if they are not eligible for work the employer usually offers visa sponsoring or help them to obtain legal work permits, but not by just disregarding the applications. If you were in my shoes, how would it make you feel? I'm pretty sure it would burn it, now wouldn't it?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've found the tech support very helpful- but I must say that if the problem can be addressed via email, it is much easier and more pleasant than working over the telephone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hiring illegals is.... illegal####$$##%NEGATIVE
When your computer crashes and the software is on it, you have to call them. Just hope your PC never blue screens with Rosetta Stone on it####$$##%NEGATIVE
amazing! now I need to learn so that I can speak to my son's fiance and surprise her!####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually I did have that happen.  They were very helpful in getting the permissions set up so that I reinstalled on a new machine very quickly.  A dead machine is not a happy thing.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sure wish I had the same experience. If you have an inside track on someone to talk with at Rosetta Stone let me know. I'm upset that I've invested in the software and my laptop simply crashed. They say the only way to get the license back is to retrieve it from the computer. Pretty hard to do when the hard drive is gone. Its not like I'm trying to pirate a copy of the software. I just want to use it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Rachel.  I will send you a Facebook message tomorrow.  Your help is greatly appreciated!####$$##%POSITIVE
yes i have :) i'm very fleuent in english now :D i try to speak english every day so i loose my accent####$$##%POSITIVE
Pls pls Rosetta Stone...offer a more accessible version of your software for those with lower incomes...or at least re-release it to public libraries so that we can try it out...  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Like to buy it but price too high , need to learn mandrine chineses####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
price is worth it####$$##%POSITIVE
totally agree ! great learning experience !####$$##%POSITIVE
I think it is probably a stronger foundation than you`ll get compared with most other foreign language programs,Kaliana,but(imho)not as strong a start as you`d get from a physical college language course(i.e. 5 days a week,2hrs per class,and additional voice lab time).Much of the process depends on how an individual learns best.Sure you`ll go as far as you want to go,Ms Littlefield! If you find a particular tongue you love then you`ll excel almost effortlessly! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am nervous for about the first 15 seconds and then I am fine :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I did a lot better this time then last week. I scheduled another one for Friday it will be evern better :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I do! Nervous wreck during the countdown and after 5 mins I'm fine!####$$##%POSITIVE
Michele: I've heard from a teacher it is a little hard. She read it in German.####$$##%NEGATIVE
OMG... I have to read HP series in english but I don't know when :((####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've got to tell you...whoever is in charge of the Rosetta Stone FB page...you rock.  You always post the most interesting links/articles and I look forward to them every day.  I read them, share them, pass them on... thanks for a great job and keeping it interesting!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool! Italian is such a cool sounding language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Very excited for you!  And Janice is right, it comes pretty quickly!  I hope you have a fabulous time learning Italian!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Sharon...  having a marvelous time.  Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Rachel...  I'm still on Level 1, Unit 4.  Did my first Studio session the other day.  A little shy but I held up.  Lei insignente was molto bellisima... e molto paziente!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've gotten really good at it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love that Evelyn.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am on Rosetta Stone every day at all different times and I am yet to see anyone logged into Simbio except me (German).  I just don't get it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks everyone!  I'm anxious to try it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the same problem. Tried different times, but never met anybody.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
No, more like 15...I have been out of China since 1990, so I use Rosetta Stone to help retain what I learned.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
yay very happy when I see more poeple learning Japanese! haha####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too Caitlen. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am moving there in 2years, but I shall be visitng there quite often now til then! It really has helped me! <3####$$##%POSITIVE
definitely! just like spanish and italian or russian and ukranian, they have similar roots, and can come in handy for the "bare-bones"####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! In fact, if you are a speaker of English, you have a head start in learning Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch, German, Frisian and a few more. There was a time back in the early 1980's where I was learning three languages at once because of being in the same language family (German, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish).####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish and italian are so close..I do that with portuguese all the time. Amazingly, we all understand each other. LOL####$$##%POSITIVE
i tried. got much farther with korean for dummies - $10. it was literally impossible to understand the sounds that were being made with no letters and no course on learning hangul. but thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@RS - I learned Arabic with your course and found the alphabet scary at first but very useful in understanding grammar and pronunciation and then just lots of fun by itself.  @Steve, I am familiar with the language for Dummies courses and they do not even come close to what you would have learned in RS.    Can you say anything useful in Korean?   I can here: أعتقد أنك لا تفهم الفرق في الدورات.####$$##%POSITIVE
finally new japanese studio coaches!####$$##%POSITIVE
I cannot wait until I can start my Japanese again. I've missed it.  I still remember stuff that I did.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ahhh I miss my japanese lessons  :/####$$##%POSITIVE
I think it is worth it because I am able to play simbio games with native japanese speakers in Japan. They help me a lot with japanese in addition to RS. It made my japanese learning experience less stressfull.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wonderful!!!!!  Thank you, Simy!!!!!  =))))))####$$##%POSITIVE
Simy, your explanation is very helpful!!   Maybe RS could have some "ask the expert" sessions where we could ask these kind of questions.####$$##%POSITIVE
The Rosetta Audio Programs also work well with both German 1-5 and Spanish 1-5. Great job Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
I also found for me printing out the coursework and reading it improved my reading/understanding immensely because I didn't have the pictures I had to sound it out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Christy.  I'll try it when I get home from work tonight.  The instructions said to select "add another level" when after putting in the application CD, but it never gave me that option.  Then I tried the chat last night, but it didn't recognize my password which I've used many times. So then I tried the reset password function, and when I clicked on the link that RS sent to my gmail account  it came back and said "The department is not configured correctly".  So by that time I was totally frustrated. Thank you very much for your quick response this morning, and I'll try it tonight.####$$##%POSITIVE
That did it.  Thank you Christy.####$$##%POSITIVE
I believe that the Totale is the total package of the course (either online or the CDs) and the online portion of the studio, games, and stories.  It is a supplement to the CDs and follows the course.  IF you get the program all online, then you get the course and the studios, etc. as a whole.  If you get the CDs, you have the course forever, but the online portion is free for 3 months, and then you have to pay extra.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the response :) I have already purchased levels 1 to 5, it says that I have activated them when I go to 'activate levels' so am struggling. When going on Support Portal I cant find where to chat to someone! Where do I look on Support to chat to you?####$$##%NEGATIVE
As with all of their language learning the principles of learning are the same and the concepts and sequence of concepts are similar for all language. What you have heard for other languages, especially hose without the Latin alphabet will also be true for hebrew.  You will be learning modern Hebrew, not classical Hebrew but the course is a great start for whatever direction you may then wish to go.    If you buy it direct from them, then you have six months to decide for yourself and then return it no questions asked, for a full refund if that is your wish.  I think that is the best way to answer your question, risk free and try it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had my first last week and second last night....am hooked!  I was only student last night so had 121 session!####$$##%POSITIVE
oooh Rachel...a girl does lots of crazy things for a man!! Now Im done w Level 1, kind of just breezed tru it but level 2 will prob be a lot harder, so bring it on Rosetta, Im ready n pumped ;))) I wish there were dutch speaking ppl here in Phoenix AZ, id be fun to see how Id do...Thx so much again! xo####$$##%POSITIVE
Alright, Well Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
okay thank you too Ashleigh!####$$##%POSITIVE
When I try to load it, it just keeps loading (the initial picture just stays up there and has a place where it says your friends like certain languages.)####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, actually when I try to click "select a language", nothing happens, and the what your friends say section keeps trying to load.  I don not think that it is a pop-up blocker.  Could it be a server problem in that it cannot load?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Potentially the issue is with the network on the coaches end, based on what you are saying. Many of the coaches work from home.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had that problem too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Rachel - live help during studio sessions is not very helpful.  I have learned that if you can tolerate what is going on, best to leave well enough alone than to use your help service during a session.  They are disruptive to the other learners as they shot gun solutions and will "shoot" before they really know if what they recommend is effective or even relevant.  My first session, the coach was a little late and not knowing the system, I thought the software was the problem.  Live help, clearly with no reason at all had me restart my computer ... by the time the computer was back, the coach had concluded that I had not shown up and left.  Live help did not even understand the process well enough to have let the coach know she needed to hang in while we sorted things out.   Live help just does not get what is happening in a studio session.  Clumsy would be the kind word.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can read that in french and thks again Rosetta Stone####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both, I was trying to figure out the best way to go, online vs CD.  I am going to Germany in about 9 months and I am a quick study when it comes to language.  It seems the online is the cheaper way to go since levels 1-5 on CD are $500####$$##%POSITIVE
Mary, the course guides that Janice referred to are at the bottom of this page:  http://support.rosettastone.com/ics/support/KBResult.asp?searchFor=german  Have a great time learning German.  It's one of the languages I've studied with RS and I had a super positive experience!  Where in Germany are you headed?####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck, Laura!  I haven't been able to get through to support via phone or chat.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I contacted Rosetta Stone support last night using online chat. The support staff were able to fix my Rosetta Stone program.  Learning Spanish (Latin America), once again.  Thank you, Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the German program, and am in the 5th level.  It has really given me a lot of confidence to speak the language. After 8 classes at the university, I was like so many others.  Now, I try to use the language whenever I can.  Great program!! DO the studios!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Italian. I've already finish level 1,2 & 3 & the expirience it's been great. Hopefully I wil be able to be fluent by the end of the year & then I will start French & German simultaneously! I have tell all my friends about RS!!! I have to repeat this.....the costumer service you have is AMAZING !!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've also have downloaded the audio companion & the mobile app to my iPod. I'm using the tools 360!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I did it!!! I ended up posting it on Youtube and uploading it that way!!  I learned so much about making a video!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I live in California and I have seen studio sessions available any where from 2:30 in the morning to 11:30 at night.  I don't think your work shift will be a problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Sharon. I find it amazing too because I still cannot do that.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oui!! Merci de votre apport!####$$##%POSITIVE
If there is something I could help with, Id love to do that. I speak bosnian :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just did! Thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is wonderfully helpful! Thank you, Janice!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have noticed lately that the studios have more technical problems.  THey are fun.  Is there a compatibility problem with your computer?  I had some problems with my anti-virus and had to get a new anti-viral problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
During a recent Studio, the coach repeatedly apologized for "server problems".   I hope they get fixed soon.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Janice, those are good points and  I did turn off my anti- virus but conintued to have the same problems.  I have spent over 12+ hours w/ technical support and they still haven't "figured" it out.  Probably because they keep looking at my system instead of theirs.  I am keeping hope alive that they will refine their system and give us all a more enjoyable and consistent experience.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay, that's weird.  It just let me sign in.  The password was still in the box from the last time I tried so I know I didn't type it in wrong.  Very strange!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have done many studios ok. The few that didn'tall I had to do was re-boot. The last one was an ISP issue as hubby , at same time, could not consistently keep logged on on his laptop.Maybe too much traffic to the ISP server for a Friday night. I already have the highest speed connection, but that can fluctuate, like a traffic jam. ATT has nice video about internet speed and factors that can effect it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Has to get a new anti-viral program.  Luckily, the new one was free.  Maybe there is some other problem with the server or just the connection in general. YOu may want to contact the Concierge service and see if they can get someone who can "cut through the red tape" so that you can really get the help you need.  You should not have to spend 12 hours with tech support!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am currently using RS and I say it works, Rs is a good program to start out with, Rs gives you the tools, you have to construct your foundation to learn the language. I am learning Latin American Spanish myself and as soon as I get the feel of it I am getting portuguese. No language is a problem If you have the drive to learn it. What language do you want to learn?####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to learn many of the same languages you do. But i decided to start with Japanese because I have more experience with it. I think RS is a good program and you can learn a lot with it. I'm currently using it for Japanese & Korean.####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Angel, I just saw a post of a woman using the Japanese program and she made it seem as though the program itself was confusing and not worth her time. Idk if its because she isnt putting forth the effort, or what, but she really had some negative opinions about it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Frazier, in my opinion, the romance languages are "quicker" to pick up for those of us who speak English as a native language. Japanese, for me, felt like less "fun" and more "work" but that's because it just required more effort. But I've read comments by several folks here on fb who've learned Japanese and Arabic with RS and had a great time doing so. Have you tried the demos? They really give you a good feel for *exactly* how RS works in the course/learning mode. RWorld and RStudio are wonderful and are really fun/entertaining supplements to the course content.  I am currently in level 3 of Spanish.  While I'm not "fluent", I feel pretty comfortable being able to communicate basic thoughts and daily activities in a very basic way using Spanish.  I can opt to read the Spanish instructions on things and understand what's meant.  I can look around my environment and identify almost everything by its Spanish term.  So I really feel like it's a very good investment of your time and money.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm turning 32 next month. I didn't officially start learning languages until I was in my twenties. I've always had that fascination with other languages. I just wouldn't do it. I think it was partially because growing up I didn't know anyone that learned another language. I understand what you mean about our community. We do hear too much negativity. I do want to be a positive role model.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is very ambitious Frazer, I am sure with time and patience you will be able to learn all of those languages. Any language you learn it will get frustrating, with me I can read the and understand some when its spoken, but I still dont feel comfortable enough to have a conversation and I have a little issue keeping everything in.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did a demo for Japanese and Chinese before I bought, and used the Roman letters.  It made it easier for me, and I still can learn characters at my own pace.  YOu have to change the settings in the program.  I plan to get Russian as well, but will have to learn the Russian alphabet as I do not think that they ROmanize it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Frazier, Angel can confirm if I'm right but I believe that RS does use all 4 alphabets in the Japanese version.  I know when I started out, I changed the setting from the default to Romanji just to make my life easier.  And I know someone else mentioned that Kanji was introduced a little later (I think she said lvl 3).  There's an app I use for the iPhone called Kanji Flip to practice my kanji recognition.####$$##%POSITIVE
it is great because you will learn in a total different way and if u love ur pc or internet u can take it online ias AWESOME!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've never read a negative online review from someone who really used RS.   You will enjoy it and learn quickly.  I've learned enough LA Spanish to have fun conversations with native Spanish speakers in my community.  If you buy directly from RS, you can try it for up to 6 months.   Go for it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank a lot ; )####$$##%POSITIVE
Atitat, Evelyn's comments were spot on. I am also actually using LA Spanish.  I've just started level 3 and, while not fluent, I can identify most items I see by their Spanish name and can also communicate common ideas (in mostly understandable sentences).  I'd really encourage you to try it.  Like Evelyn said, if you purchase through RS directly, there's a 6 month money back guarantee.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's completely wiped out the joy and interest I have in learning the language I've chosen to study with all the frustration it's caused. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Valeree, I've used Rosetta Stone for 4 languages, and Japanese (for me) was very frustrating compared to the others.  So I feel your pain.  I don't know if any of this will help you, but here's the support/suggestions I can offer you...  Instead of jumping right in with the symbols, you can set the course to romanji which is the words written out phonetically using the Latin/English alphabet.  At least that will let you "sound out" what you are hearing.  I did the section in romanji, then went back and did it with the symbols.  It's slower, but it works.  Try playing MemGo in the games section.  It's a matching game and will let you start to directly connect the vocabulary word with the picture.  There are *lots* of Japanese learners who participate here on this FB wall.  I would use them for support, questions, etc.    The RS method really works best with a "Breathe, Believe, and go with the flow attitude".  It really does all come together as long as you put in a regular effort.  Good luck!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I know native Japanese speakers and they looked at it and said that it was a good start.  I think that RS can give you a good basis, but you really need to speak with natives, read, listen to stuff on the internet (TV< etc.) to really speak well.  With me, I am looking for conversational fluency, not near-native, so RS is good (but still a challenge!)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm on Level 2 of German.  I LOVE Rosetta Stone!!!!!  ####$$##%POSITIVE
It is interesting now that aim on Level 2 and the increased speed of the speech by the voice actors and I can actually understand (most) of it compared to the slow speech at the beginning.  I can't wait to visit Germany next year.####$$##%POSITIVE
With all said above, I'll say this: TOTALe is worth every single penny! Its amazing how it takes you outside of the course and prepares you for real conversations - because it gives you real people to converse with.  Good luck John!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Merri...let me know when you are going to be in Rosetta World.  I am always looking to play some Duo games.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great!!!  Thanks James!####$$##%POSITIVE
I took German for 3 years in high school.  I love the language.  I am 58 now and trying to learn Latin American Spanish with Rosetta Stone software.  I agree with one post that it is definitely easier to learn a new language earlier in life, but I am progressing and will not give up.  I remember very little of my high school German, but I do wish I was fluent in Spanish.  Hopefully someday soon.  It is a valuable asset to know Spanish in my workplace.####$$##%POSITIVE
LOL--I'll check- in from time-to-time as we begin to make progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
"Being a cultural person is awesome. :)"  I love that comment. That could be something written on a RS tee-shirt.####$$##%POSITIVE
Impressive ####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice, great job, Jennifer. :D####$$##%POSITIVE
When you hit a word related to one in English, it feels like a treat in Arabic.####$$##%POSITIVE
it does!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. I contacted their customer service. I do have the receipt, and I did register it immediately. My issue is that I have to prove that it is still me, even though I registered and can answer all their questions to confirm.  They even have to validate if I try to deauthenticate a live install.  Imagine if you had to do that with iTunes? I understand them trying to protect themselves against piracy of software, but this hoop-jumping is ridiculous. Particularly the issue that if my computer CRASHES and I reinstall on the SAME COMPUTER, it uses another authentication - even though *smart* software can validate that the ESN of the computer is the same and it is really a reinstall. These details make the difference between good user experiences and bad. And nowhere in the instructions - WHICH I READ - does it specify any of this hoop jumping. Now I did buy this long ago - perhaps it is better now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@ Barbara, I sent you a friend request. I'll be happy to help friends reunite :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Shanice!  much appreciated####$$##%POSITIVE
I believe that RS works.  I went through all 5 levels of German, and am now am working through Italian.  I bought Japanese and Chinese to start in a few weeks.  I have always enjoyed languages and am conversationally fluent in Spanish and French.  THe RS  method takes some getting used to because you have to figure everything out.  Personally, I think that I like trying to figure it out because I remember better. With Japanese and Chinese, I am going to use romanji and Pinyin (respectively) since my goal is to speak.  I can always study the written language at my leisure.####$$##%POSITIVE
Of course it works!!, Try it!! I've been practicing with german and italian, and I have improved!!####$$##%POSITIVE
There was a combination of problems going on- the transcripts didn't match the course/lesson I was taking, so I the support person couldn't figure out what was wrong- it took someone on their side that knew Japanese to actually launch the program and discover that...  And there's been problems with the speech plugin not working correctly on my Mac- it gets caught in a recursive "you don't have this installed" loop, until you tell it "skip the speech"... then it launches speech! (@_@; )  ...and strangely, when it does launch, unless I have it on the strictest settings for accuracy, it says I'm pronouncing things wrong- but in "normal" mode, it will gladly accept obscenities in English instead, as the correct Japanese pronunciations of unrelated words... (>.<; )  ...so I learned everything wrong, and had to start it all over again, using Google Translate to teach me syllable by syllable, because I couldn't get assistance from a live teacher, even in text chat mode or e-mail.   Before I solved most of the errors on my own with Google's help, I was on the verge of throwing my laptop computer across the room in frustration- it's not been a fun experience so far.  ⧜(´ο` )  m( _ _ ; )m~*####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the help- am sorted :-) already started level 2 and loving it already!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yay! Thank you so much, everyone- I can't wait to get started ^_^ This will be a tremendous savings over the $360 I was going to pay for 30 hours of online lessons! (Maybe I'll use the money I save to purchase my own Rosetta program in another language ;)  Just one more question: How do I sign up?####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome thank you! Do I need to send you my email address?####$$##%POSITIVE
It was a real feeling of accomplishment####$$##%POSITIVE
How fantastic!  Congratulations!  And I'm sure you made her feel fantastic too!  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
That is wonderful and I'm sure it was a wonderful feeling to be able to communicate in Chinese. Congrats. Reminds me one when I spoke to a man in Japanese. He was too shocked to respond. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
That is so cool, Angel. I had the privilege of seeing my son converse with native Japanese speakers.  They were so enthusiastic and grateful about his being able to speak their language.  As a mom, I can tell you it was one of the best experiences I've ever had.  I'm so glad you're enjoying your language journey!####$$##%POSITIVE
WOW!  I bet she was impressed!####$$##%POSITIVE
So very proud of you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for responding - I am aware now that I can purchase further access, I just hadn't budgeted or expected to have to spend more after buying the full 5-level application. Is there no way to get access just to the ipad app, without the Studio sessions? That's all I really want, and wouldnt have ongoing costs to you on its own...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks a lot, I would be happy to trial the service for you and feed back! Because I could be doing some Spanish now instead of messing around on Facebook.. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
rosatte nın dvd si bulunmakta bende. dvd den flash belleğe ingilizce dil paketini kopyaladım ama şuanda açamıyorum. rosetta proğramı ilerlemiyor. nasıl yapıcam :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your quick reply. I knew that was the reason but I still think there is a limit to the  umber of times you can expect a person to hear the same one over and over without a way to find success. I like that game, but I wish I didn't have to face Marissa and her aunt one more time without figuring out the words! Maybe I will find an Italian friend to help me! Thanks again for following up on my issue!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Taylor.  It's interesting, I always ask, "How do you write/spell that?" when I hear a new word.  Now I know why.  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I swear I was browsing the website last month and saw a $20 for 12-months subscription to the Spanish program.... I just went back right now to buy it, and I don't see it anymore. Just $199 for 3 months. Sheesh! I'm super disappointed...I wonder if I was imagining it, but I don't think I was?####$$##%NEGATIVE
And you may get kicked out of studios if they ask you if you have a cordless headset and you do.  I get asked about every third session.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ever since I watched the animated movie Anastasia I have been enamored by all things Russian. I took Russian as an independent study in high school and excelled but unfortunately could not continue my studies. Now I can :)####$$##%POSITIVE
got it thank you sooooooo much!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have a year on you and I am learning Arabic and reviewing French and Russian with RS.    Learning a new language- particularly one with a different form of writing- is supposd to be good for our aging brains. ;-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am 47 and decided to learn German. It's going good so far.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is alot of languages, I wonder is there anyone in the world that can speak every single language in the world.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Congrats Jennifer. I can't wait to get back to level 2. Studying Japanese with RS just helped me love the language even more.####$$##%POSITIVE
I was worried about my first studio session today after L1U1.  The coach was so nice.  It was a lot of fun, even if I had to say "no say" a lot.  I think that is how you write it.  It means "i don't know".####$$##%POSITIVE
and for certain languages 20 a month for a year. The price has gone down a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
OK I checked that link out and that's what I found before. I guess i was confused because I was expecting to find a big price tag and not just only a $20 monthly subscription cost. Interesting. Danke!####$$##%POSITIVE
Which would mean i can get the whole package for just a one year sub for $240. That sounds too good a deal to be true :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It's true. I have two languages that way. It shocked me too. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Angel, for confirming. I was totally expecting to have to dish out over $1k. Guess I read the wrong reviews. This new pricing model is Perfekt!####$$##%POSITIVE
You're welcome. The 20 a month is pretty new and I love it that way. I wouldn't have gotten more than one language if it wasn't that way.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both for your assistance. I have now purchased it and can hardly wait to go home. Plus my GF is from Germany so I can practice with a real person every day!####$$##%POSITIVE
i have rosetta stone and i LOVE it!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Would love to enter but don't live in the US!! Love Rosetta Stone though...doing French to level 5.####$$##%POSITIVE
Why are none of the draws available to people living outside the USA. There are people out there using RS that would like these sorts of things as well, but we don't have the opportunity to enter into any of the draws.####$$##%NEGATIVE
and even tho i get everything right bc of that error if lowers my score and bc of that it wont unlock certain things like the stories####$$##%NEGATIVE
yeah it says like 4111 i believe####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok so it helps for like ten min and it starts up again...i have readded the language cd twice any other suggestions...its really annoying####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok, I must have hit a nerve since you all appear to be getting defensive. Yeah, I'm pretty far into the course. I use "running" as an example, because its in the first lesson and RS never comes back to it. I could also go with Pluralization, Object and Subject markers, also all in the first chapter, which never get any real explanation. It's easy to mistake these markers for syllables of the word itself, unless you already posess a little working knowledge of the language, or do as I did and spend a few hours going through a Korean to English dictionary trying to figure out why the word everyone else who actually speaks it is different from what you are using, and making fun of you for. Again, as an example from the first lesson, which I am far past now and have not had any explanation of, 들. I had to look that up on my own, which considering my computer can't emulate Korean characters, was a pain! Three hours after starting to look for that, I came across a pluralization lesson from someone online. The word being used in front of it. It wasn't "people" it wasn't "adults" and it wasn't "Men and women." But that's the photo that went with it. I have no clue what that word means, but thanks to Rosetta Stone, I now associate it with "Adults."   This is again what I am kind of getting at. It's becoming very clear that Rosetta Stone doesn't take constructive criticism well, but I'll say it again, for a complex langage like Korean, the immersion thing helps you learn what RS presents very well. I can repeat it back and understand it well. But the meanings aren't clear, and the progam could be better. Even if sold as an add-on, although I'd prefer it as part of the lessons, a list of vocab, gramatical markers, and sentences defined would be incredibly helpful as a learning tool. Not everyone learns solely by immersion. It's quite narrow minded to think that this is the only way you learn, or go to some other product. Especially when the images you present are often unclear, or the words used are less commonly used by native speakers. I'm on level 2, not lesson 2. I've been through the first level, and I can do well with what you've given me. But i could be doing better if the learning tool were a little more flexible and nuanced as opposed to the rigid set in stone tool it is. If there was a book or even a simple PDF that went with it, I could have been making my own sentences back in the first lessons rather than just repeating back the ones I've learned. That would be a pretty good way to learn a language too, don't you think?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I always wanted Rosetta Stone because I always heard it was the best way to learn another language (I probably heard it from Rosetta Stone themselves in adds) but it's all a bunch of hype. First off, it cost way WAY too much money! And the whole "Guarantee" thing is just a bunch of crap! I spent a lot of my school funding to get Rosetta Stone in Spanish. I was so excited to finally get it. But let me tell you, I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!! It was horrible! I had so many problems with it! So NOT WORTH it! You are better off hiring a personal tutor to teach you the language. Not only is hiring a personal tutor cheaper, it's also MUCH more effective. May you all BE WARNED. DO NOT WASTE your MONEY on ROSETTA STONE!####$$##%NEGATIVE
perfect thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
After trying to pull up what i wanted it just says loading...it doesnt look like its working either####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's wonderful! Be proud of your accomplishment, I've been told that English is the hardest language to learn. Congratulations to Reem!####$$##%POSITIVE
that's an amazing story...####$$##%POSITIVE
Molly, I went into the lesson thinking that it was going to be hard past tense "preterito" stuff. But, it had things in it that were not past tense. I was able to keep up for a change. :)))####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias mi amiga profesora!!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks dude ! and good luck :D!####$$##%POSITIVE
im seriously considering ending it back and i have only had it for a week all im getting is error 4111 and even after i did what u told me to do i still get it and now after following ur advice from earlier i get this new error and it wont let me do anything on the program####$$##%NEGATIVE
...on the other hand, Rosetta Stone works well for many (LIKE ME)####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with you renee. I got rosetta stone for Japanese and as soon as I trying to talk with native speakers they had no clue what I meant. I figured out I was saying stuff wrong because there are nothing but pictures and I knew how to write it but as far as knowing exactly what it meant I was so off. With no English to even help you it is way too hard to know exactly what you're saying. I returned it for my money back. I'll stick with free web sites and free chats with native speakers to learn.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Same here Evelyn. I find it easily understandable even in a language like Japanese. I understand what's being said. My only problem is grammar rules because they aren't taught.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sorry, I came off a little strong but it just frustrates me to think of all the time and money wasted. It may work for some people but my brother and I tried it and we were not happy with the results. We ended up taking a Spanish class and hiring a personal tutor and we found it much more effective.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Italian works just fine for me.  I received compliments when in Sicilia and that was only after completing levels 1-3.  However, I used other methods along with Rosetta.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to learn Arabic with Rosetta Store, but no money right now. I heard its really good. Andy, how would you rate it?####$$##%POSITIVE
I think 4 out of 5. To be honest I feel the less u know the better. Sometimes past learning experience can interfere a little. But learned alot of Turkish. Haven't done Arabic as much as us like so inshallah I'm going to get back to it. Try the online demo for a language u have no experience in and then u can have a pure experience in seeing whether the format works for u. For me I tried French and saw it was working well so I bought Turkish. ####$$##%POSITIVE
anxiously awaiting Android.....####$$##%POSITIVE
.... thank you. Rant is over.####$$##%POSITIVE
rofl! Nice advice though. All my savings that were spent on Rosetta Stone was worth it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I do love RS. I think I'm doing a lot with Japanese. When I finish that I have two more languages with RS to tackle.####$$##%POSITIVE
Let me tell you Rosetta Stone is great. I also use Teach Yourself: Beginner's Chinese and I would also recommend the movies "The Jasmine Woman" and if you have Mulan you can change the language to Mandarin.... Watch WITHOUT the subtitles####$$##%POSITIVE
Jennifer, I spent about $649 on my version 3 some 2 years ago.  It has been worth every single penny. I later recieved V4 as a gift and am so grateful for it. So to hear others complain about their current price... thats just not cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
people have a right to complain when this company decides to remove the $20 per month option.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I LOVE BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
now they expect us to pay 250 at once!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do too, but some people are upset cause RS doesnt have European Portuguese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
LOL Thats real talk Matt, I think RS lowered their prices considerably, and I got LA Spanish and I love it, and Portuguese and maybe Possibly Danish is the next ones on the list.####$$##%POSITIVE
Brasilian is only 80% Portuguese. The rest is Creole, spanish and a bunch of other European languages mixed in. Add the strange dialect and slang and you can see how people could be confused and even annoyed:)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm annoyed by that too Ben. I got mine that way.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That would be nice if all the languages had that option, but that means it would take 1 to 2 yrs to pay it off.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm fine with a taking a year to complete it. It's still a year's subscription but you have to pay it all at once instead of 20 a month. The price is higher than what it was at 20 a month.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Now see, I don't mind the $20/month option. Thats not the issue. I know for a fact that if enough people wanted it, they'd keep that option. I'm also betting they have payment plans if you were to ask for them.####$$##%POSITIVE
"I dare you to find a product cheaper that compares apples-to-apples" I'd take you up on that, but I'm not allowed to say here. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
These are the reactions that are expected from anyone who doesn't know the history of Portugal and are not able to speak true Portuguese. In all fairness, continental Portuguese has existed for almost 2000 years and DESERVES TO BE PRESERVED... Then again, I DON'T EXPECT ANY OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You'll never learn something if it's not taught properly.. And if companies like Rosetta Stone choose to misinform the public then it's everyone's resposibility to aid in correcting the problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh snap! ...  You're growth is about 2 every 7-16 seconds...  so I'm thinking between 10:30 - 10:40 PM EST.  I could TOTALLT be wrong though!####$$##%POSITIVE
hmm... that isn't right because that leaves you at about gaining ~112 fans.  ..... oops.  A-well, thats what I said so thats what I have to stick to!####$$##%POSITIVE
I know right? When i started learning Japanese i saught out a few natives Japanese people on Facebook (don't get the wrong idea, I'm not a perv) to help me learn a bit more and too see where i stand. And surprisingly enough, In the 2 months i learned with RS, I was able to speak about basic stuff, like how was their day, What school they attend and small uncomplex stuff like that. A truly great product.####$$##%POSITIVE
It sometimes drives me crazy though because she will be in the kitchen talking to herself in Japanese and I'll think she is talking to me. She gets all teenagery (is that a word?) and tells me I made her loose her train of thought. LOL####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Bradley I will. That should really throw her for a loop. LOL####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm glad she's catching on quick. I'm also studying that language. I quite like it. I took it in school and have quite a few friends that speak it because of that.####$$##%POSITIVE
Argh I spoke to soon, problem still not solved.   I'll be back in contact tomorrow though now, when I'm less likely to throw my laptop over the balcony!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got the online version, and I've since gone back to buy the discs. I wish I'd bought the discs in the first place. You get three months online for free with the discs, then you pay to add more months of online if you want (but at a much cheaper rate than if you're an online only subscriber).####$$##%NEGATIVE
cool,thanx.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you rosetta stone :)####$$##%POSITIVE
ok####$$##%POSITIVE
Could you please work on a level 6 of Rosetta Stone Spanish? I am nearing completion of level 5 and I'm so use to using the program every day, I don't want to stop :-(####$$##%POSITIVE
TOTALe 1-5 ITALIANO.... just got it!> AWEsome...!####$$##%POSITIVE
no thank you rosseta stone####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was the same with French! I want another 5 levels! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much !!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Javier: I doubt it will ever get that low. I wish they would bring back the 20 a month plan. That's how I got my three languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
My #1 reason for learning Chinese is because I want to go to China! #ThxRS...MoreThanWords.Stories.####$$##%POSITIVE
that just makes me want to wait for next year.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Is good####$$##%POSITIVE
Is very good####$$##%POSITIVE
I wanted to know: Is this deal only for the entire 1-5 set? I only need 3-5, does the price change for any smaller packages, or just the whole set? Anyways, thanks for making this more affordable :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Is this it?? The "big" deal? As usual, nothing for level 1-3 sets... Blah...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Javier, you cannot find a language program or class that offers a tutor, the effectiveness of Rosetta Stone, that is based on your own schedule and has all the tools TOTALe offers, for a lower price. I guarantee it.  Thank you Rosetta Stone!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Matt of course we do, it's called your local library. That's how I learned all of the languages I know. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I use the library too Brandon. It's a very resourceful place for languages. I hear RS is in certain libraries.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great price for me - I hope you all are getting fair salaries!####$$##%POSITIVE
Last year's list price maybe, but I got levels 1-5 for $450 this year, so this is only $50 off.  An ok deal but I won't be rushing off to get another language just yet. Don't get me wrong I disagree with the others saying its not worth the price though. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Brandon, what languages do you speak? Do you consider yourself conversationally proficient in them? How long did it take you to get to that level in each of them (this is of course not counting your native language)####$$##%POSITIVE
Does it really work??? I hope it does, im thinking abt the spanish language.   Please reply.####$$##%POSITIVE
:( The Japanese language only has 3 sets.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Today I just bought levels 1-5 of Mandarin.  I can hardly wait to get started learning when it gets here.  I move to Shanghai in 8 weeks, so this sale came just in time for me.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
IF i catch a good sale, below 200.00 would be more fair. Not everyone is rich.####$$##%NEGATIVE
:( do you think you could have a sale on your 1-3 lvl languages? Those are the ones I want to learn the most, like Hindi, farsi, latin...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can get the 1 - 5 for 399 @ amazon already - where is the saving?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Can I order this tomorrow? Or the sale online ends tonight at midnight?####$$##%POSITIVE
@Tammy, I'm going through Spanish now and it is really amazing how easy it is and home much I'm retaining. Well worth the price in my opinion.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Andy... So there is hope, lol.####$$##%POSITIVE
Man, I just ordered the 5 set Spanish for$450. Wish I had waited!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Damn.... have to stay strong...####$$##%POSITIVE
Still to much for me to hand out at once right now....would like for it to come down maybe another $100####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome! I'm wanting to do Russian after I finish German L5 but wasn't confident about it because of the non-Roman alphabet. Good to hear it works :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm looking at Russian, too.  I have taken courses in the past, but really want to understand better.####$$##%POSITIVE
Why is Rosetta stone so expensive? Why can't we get one for free or at least cheaper? ####$$##%NEGATIVE
no one cares. we speak english anyway####$$##%POSITIVE
You can buy it in differed 5 payments! Directly in the online store. So it doesn't burden you as much. And it's worth it, Really! Besides, you've got the 6 month Guarantee.. how much confidence do you think RS has in it's product to Guarantee something as hard to show how effective it is when learning usually depends on the User, and still they'll bet on it. Try it, you'll spend that money on something less productive every month any way, RS is soo worth it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow, that was an amazing quote. Keep 'em coming!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning to speak German with Rosetta Stone and it's fun. It's also good for the mind.####$$##%POSITIVE
I wanna learn Gaelic and Latin! I wanna learn Spanish with my son...####$$##%POSITIVE
If your programs weren't so expensive, I would def get one... But they are so ...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yay, someone else who wants to learn Gaelic!####$$##%POSITIVE
I like Portuguese, yes in Europe where it started from I understand what you saying, but no one is being decieved, every portuguese country has a different dialect, but anyone who speaks it proper no matter what dialect can be understood.####$$##%POSITIVE
Several reasons:  1.  We have a 1 year-old.  Her babysitter is Spanish.  Lexi is learning Spanish so it is good for me to know some to continue her learning at home.  Her first word was Agua!  2.  My wife and I travel to the Caribbean quite often.  It would be nice to be able to communicate with the people we meet down there.  3.  My father-in-law owns a place in Costa Rica.  They are learning Spanish, so it would be fun to work together with them as well.  4.  My friend John R Kewell started the program a while back and he told me how great the Rosetta Stone program is, so he convinced me to try it.  All and all, I have been having a lot of fun.  I wish I could spend more time working on it, but I have been working 12 hour days, 7 days a week, so it has been making it difficult.  That being said, even if I can only work on it an hour a week, I will still learn more than not doing it at all.  Plus, it isn't really "work" because it is so much fun!  I look forward to my next session...hopefully soon!  Thank you...muchas gracias!  Chris Denholm####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
oh brilliant :) So i just install version 4 application and it all does it , good####$$##%POSITIVE
I just had one this week after taking a break. Mine was awesome but I need to get used to it again.####$$##%POSITIVE
Where are these specials? We have been waiting for them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
In my session she had us try and say parts of the little red riding hood story.####$$##%POSITIVE
That sounds cool. One of my funnest so far has been when we dressed up a mannequin to look like us.####$$##%POSITIVE
That sounds funny, you can imagine how hard it was to try and tell that story in spanish, but it was funny too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! It is so very nice of you to respond so quickly! I do adore Cyber Monday! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
I learned Arabic in 3 levels.  What I found is that once I really mastered what RS provided, text books for the language, intended for a classroom are actually quite useful in going further as is on line resources, making friends who speak the language and so on.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Audrey, I was a little overwhelmed at first too. My left-brain wanted to know what each word meant before I had to use it but I had to let that go. I think you'll have a better experience if you don't expect the course to be a certain way and just trust that you'll get there. Hang in there and you really will "get it". I'm really enjoying it now. I jumped into the online games and sessions with the instructors. They are so patient and they have really made it a lot more fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thankyou very much Marie, I will keep trying. I'm glad to hear someone else was overwhelmed by the way it teaches, but I guess I will have to do what you did too and just let it go. Thanks for the encouragement!####$$##%POSITIVE
Will do! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
its tough im taking italian in school and through RS and its taking me forever but its gonna be worth it once i get it####$$##%POSITIVE
PLEASE FORWARD TO YOUR SUGGESTION DEPARTMENT:  ROSETTA STONE--I will buy from you once you FIX your Arabic Lessons to show the Arabic Letters and the same Arabic words in the letters that are used in the English Language.  Arabic people are typing the Arabic Language in the letters that are in the ENGLISH LANGUAGE on Facebook, etc. YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR LESSONS!####$$##%NEGATIVE
If only I could afford this program ...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, to the people who work at Rosetta Stone, for such a remarkable product!####$$##%POSITIVE
if you purchase Rosetta Stone (all 5 levels) at  best buy using your best buy card then you will get  18 months interest free!  I did that and paid it off in 9 months and paid $50.00 a month.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh BTW I love love love Rosetta Stone totale####$$##%POSITIVE
Kiosks are still offering $100 off sets of 1-5! I know. I work there! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck in French. I'm taking French through a class. I'm hoping to use it to go to Canada.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the software installed and up and running and I am *loving* it !!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh and Silent night in Japanese is called, "Kiyoshi Kono Yoru" !  Fun Fact! haha :)####$$##%POSITIVE
oh!!! Good Luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ahh thank you!! :)  I am planning on recording it and uploading it!! <3####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I was considering doing that but just for Youtube.####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be cool :) Silent night?####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Silent Night its really pretty :)  Do you listen to JYJ?  I need to find a JYJ buddie -.-  haha!  They are a very popular band!####$$##%POSITIVE
I most certainly will!####$$##%POSITIVE
A real beginner but am enjoying myself####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rachel    I am going slowly but surely for an old lady (75)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just ordered it today. Hope it'll work for me too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias mi amigo####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Michelle. I got Russian because I have always wanted to learn it.  After a semester and an intensive class, you'd think that I could speak it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello!  I've been interested in the history and culture for years.  Would love to visit someday, and be able to communicate.####$$##%POSITIVE
I cannot thank Sarah at Rosetta Stone enough. Rosetta Stone has stood by excellent customer service and credited the difference. I just wish other companies would be as responsive. I will certainly remember this in the future and as I tell friends and co-workers about the Rosetta Stone experience. Thanks again, Sarah and Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
The people at Rosetta Stone are only focused on profit. A few days ago they had a 20 per month option. they got rid of it right before black friday.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jill, I just posted this in another post:  I've been wanting to get the Rosetta Stone French Level 1-5 for Christmas. I saw it was on sale this past Friday (Black Friday) for $449, so I hurried up and bought it. One can imagine how disappointed I was to see that if I would have just waited two more days an even better sale was to be had and I could have got the same package for $399! I'm kind of feeling cheated...####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes, all of them that I have caught so far...  doubled י when there should only be one of them...  Have you seen my screen shots?  https://picasaweb.google.com/113150557791335889231/RosettaStone#5679492180352448786  There are only four of them there, because it took me a while to learn how to capture the images easily.####$$##%NEGATIVE
:) I just tried that, but the chat function on there isn't working and the answers aren't in the FAQ.####$$##%NEGATIVE
;) you shouldn't be marking academy standard spellings wrong in your typing sections...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't find where to order new products through my v4 interface. It looks like I could have bought additional levels to my language, but I can't find where to add the new language. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'll live :)####$$##%POSITIVE
In all honesty I am just finishing level one, but the foundation is strong enough that although I might not be able to understand every word, I can understand the general details on what is being discussed when friends speak.  I will eventually get level 4 and 5 but right now I only have 1-3.  I bought them as a set before Rosetta Stone made a level 4-5.  So far I am very impressed!  With some of the more nuanced words I need to consult a dictionary or grammar book, and having a Russian speaker in my back pocket doesn't hurt either, but for 95% of my needs I am taken care of with Rosetta Stone.  Great product guys and gals!!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Geoffrey That is a very good idea!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Keith - I think a lot of people who bash RS have never tried it and are just looking at the price. I didn't believe in the product until I tried it.  Now, after going through German and into Italian, I am starting Japanese soon.  As you say, it is the cornerstone or the framework for me.  I have people with whom I speak German, Italian, and now Japanese, so RS gives me the basics to "spread my wings"!####$$##%POSITIVE
You'll love it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just ordered it too! I took some Spanish in high school and college - my last spanish class was '04-'05 so i'm pretty rusty. Can wait to get started!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I have a big problem, I try to reinstal the program in my new computer and it is not working####$$##%NEGATIVE
bought your product;really uneffective..####$$##%NEGATIVE
I absolutely LOVE Rosetta Stone. I purchased Russian, Farsi, and Latin American Spanish.  Even my mother (a native French speaker and Spanish teacher) is enjoying them. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Works for others, including myself! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
all who purchased rosetta's stuff and found'em a totally money waste PUT I LIKE HERE RIGHT NOW####$$##%NEGATIVE
depends on the person. I think personally there is prolly a faster way to learn a language but i make do with wat i have and so far ive learned the basics of Japanese and im happy with that.ya cant please everyone is all i gotta say in the end.####$$##%POSITIVE
Walter, if you weren't happy with your purchase then you should not be a fan - simple as that rather than bringing negativity to the page.####$$##%POSITIVE
I ended up dropping out of my latin course in College, but I want to take it again. Hopefully with the Cyber Monday sale I can afford to purchase the set! That would be awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I feel like Rosetta Stone has been really effective for me so far. It doesn't make language learning an instant process, but nothing does. It makes it a lot more fun and easy. Even though I've done less than one fourth of one level of Japanese so, far when I hear it spoken I find myself picking parts of it out of the conversation. When I see it written, I can deconstruct the sentence structure even though I don't know the vocabulary yet. At the very traditional Japanese dojo I go to, they suddenly asked me to lead the class in moves I wasn't familiar with while memorizing and pronouncing the names of moves in Japanese; I was able to almost instantly memorize all of the move names and pronounce them well while still focusing on how to do the moves. I'm impressed that just one fourth of one level could do that for me.####$$##%POSITIVE
If the cyber sale is really good I would get Mandarin. I could start it next year. But I think my optimism goes too far.####$$##%POSITIVE
Noooo!!! I just bought the Russian 1-5 on Friday!!! This is depressing. Btw did German 1-5 in 3 months, went to Germany 6 months later and could speak german no problem. Rosetta Stone is the best!####$$##%NEGATIVE
you can always visit virtually anywhere now on the web- good way to keep up the skills!####$$##%POSITIVE
.... I love you guys @ Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
im learning german off this site####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I really hope you are docking like $200 off... I would be SOOOOOOO glad!!! ¡Por favor!####$$##%POSITIVE
I used to work for Rosetta Stone and I love the product.  I was able to try out all the languages as part of my job and I picked up a little of each language.  I have Spanish and Russian sets at home, I only need to find the time to concentrate on them, which I haven't been able to with a busy college schedule.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought the Spanish (Latin America) 1-5 in April and find that it's working.  It would help if I got to use it more often, but work is rude and makes me show up a lot (LOL), and if we could get the online portions to work (but engineers are working on it - for 2 months).  Eventually Christmas will arrive, work will calm down and I'll have time and energy to learn again before heading back to Mexico, my reason for learning!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am enjoying RS French level 1&2 but have had to supplement the lessons with books to understand sentence structure and grammar. I just purchased level 3 so hopefully I won't miss out on some super sale. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I want Spanish LA Lvls 1-5 because I really want to learn! It would help in school. I want to learn LA more so, even though I'm going to spain next summer!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Rosetta stone but wish the uk branch would come up with some offers!####$$##%POSITIVE
Online says $299 cyber Monday event. Is that the big reveal? Is that for levels 1-5?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'M YOUR # 1 FAN####$$##%POSITIVE
Awwww!! I love you guys!!  700,000 fans!! And here I remember when the page had about 8,000!! That tells me you're doing something right!  Congrats and keep up the good work, friends!####$$##%POSITIVE
You have taken $100 off! Now it's as much as other online stores minus their coupons! I'm disappointed... :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
AWESOME....I want to dream in Mandarin!!! First I've got to learn more vocabulary, lol.....I think I'll get there soon!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I dream in Japanese sometimes. I understand everything when I'm dreaming. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
what levels are u on bc i wanna dream in italian! lol####$$##%POSITIVE
This one is pretty simple.  They spelled house wrong over and over throughout the program.  it isn't a translation issue, it is a simple spelling mistake.  :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
The word ביית can also mean "domesticated", depending on how it's written with vowels.####$$##%NEGATIVE
but it doesn't mean house, and they have used it to mean house at least 100 times in their program (and I am only on unit three of section one) so far.####$$##%NEGATIVE

as I said, it is in there, spelled over and over again incorrectly.  Such a simple word has totally shot my confidence in the program.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I see what you mean. It does change the whole meaning of it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
;) unless they domesticated the kids too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm doing it. It is great so far! I'm on Level 2. The only thing I wish were different is that there were all five levels instead of just three. But it's still totally worth it.####$$##%POSITIVE
LOL!! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am on Level 2. I highly respect this program and its ability to aid acquisition of a language. I had no previous exposure to Hebrew, but I have made great gains toward fluency. I would say I am still on a beginning level but approaching a wide intermediate stage. I can speak and understand in a growing variety of contexts on this level and look forward to more growth from this program! I am also pleased at its ability to get me speaking fluidly and an ever-increasing rate of speed. I highly recommend this program to anyone at any age who is serious about acquiring modern Hebrew.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks...! I'll do that...!####$$##%POSITIVE
Drats! I'm 499 fans short! - how disappointing! <------ FAIL!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh there is a 1-5, that's weird because I'm looking on the site & it's only showing me set 1-3.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with Christy I wondering when there will be level 4 & 5 for Japanese. I love the Rosetta Stone for Japanese it really helps me understands my wife's native language and helps me communicate with her family in Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought the Italian (levels 1-5) and got through a level and a half before picking up an outside course (I want to meet Italians so that I can practice).  I tested out of the first two levels of the private class!  I also find that I have less anxiety about speaking than I have in the past with a language that I just took at a  college.  I took German at a college, and then finished all 5 levels of German.  I can speak better and have more confidence.  It is a great product and more than worth the price.  I am not taking college classes in Italian, unless it is literature!####$$##%POSITIVE
RS has Latin American Spanish and Spanish (SPain).  The difference is like British English and American English (loose comparison).  LA Spanish is still standard Spanish that is spoken throughout LA, but doesn't get into specific dialects.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I used the RS Arabic course and it has been great.  Really enjoyable!  It is only 3 levels (as opposed to 5 in some other products) but I've gotten far enough that I can go further on my own without classroom work.####$$##%POSITIVE
they dont have the language id want... tagalog dangit!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got my German going yaaayyy!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've just purchased my Italian. I hope this learning method works well as all the positive comments posted by privious users.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love you guys, but let's be honest here: you lowered your prices early last year, and you're trying to pass it off as a cyber Monday sale a year later? Kinda lame. Lucky it's the best product around.####$$##%POSITIVE
i remember when rosetta stone first came out it was 300 for ONE level...this is only 100 more than that! i WISH i had it in my budget id be getting myself a christmas present!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cyber Monday is over. Why did I receive your message a day late?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Bravo!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Great deal!####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought mine on Cyber Monday last year and thought I got a good deal.  Well, I did.  But this deal is even better!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Not a good deal when what you have is not on sale- Portuguese is only Level 1-3 and not on sale. No bargains to be found, move along...####$$##%NEGATIVE
wow its great ! I wish you added the phonetic reading :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am going to be a teacher. I have been contemplating for months on which language to get (German, French, or Spanish), and Spanish is by far the most practical!####$$##%POSITIVE
Muy bien!!!!! Very good!!!!!!!! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I did that months ago to help me learn Italian and it really helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
No No Simi!!! Our classes are the best and most fun. hahaha####$$##%POSITIVE
I finally got it ordered after 2 hours..The fraud company called thinking I was missssusing it and a whole bunch of problems but I got it...Now I have Rosetta stone Spanish and German! I learned so much German over the past 3 years with it I had to buy Spanish when I saw this deal! Good luck with yours####$$##%POSITIVE
Studio sessions are a great way to boost confidence!####$$##%POSITIVE
I understand I should complete the first Unit before scheduling studio sessions. Just wondered from users when they felt ready to speak and reply...  I love the Stone so far, it's fun, and I've been really good, I practice every day so far at least 30 minutes to one hour!  Since November 23, I've only missed one day!####$$##%POSITIVE
I totally agree with Charie.  Also, learning a language really does take time; Rosetta Stone is by far faster than most ways, but it still takes time.  just keep goin'.  You'll get to a point where you'll see paterns and when the level 1 stuff puts you to sleep! (thats a good thing)####$$##%POSITIVE
nope, this is great. i know my way around my Mac, so getting images made won't be a problem. I was more concerned whether the application actively looked for the CDs...(again, since I don't have an optical drive)...Now, if only the store would load so I can actually buy anything...:D####$$##%POSITIVE
Enjoy!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Вы говорят хорошо Английски! I will be embarrassed if you're not Russian.####$$##%POSITIVE

I <3 how they don't keep you waiting for your software! You order them today and they're there in about 2 or 3 days (^_^)####$$##%POSITIVE
They're very quick and I like that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would like to learn....whoa, it's here already!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the way russian sounds####$$##%POSITIVE
Awww! Shucks! Thanks!! :-D  I guess I'm just lucky that my phone happens to be one of the 7 devices it works on, too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone!  That is my plan.  Level 5 is loading right now :)  Will take care of the audio companion next.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Dude. They did. It's $350 off last year's price.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah but for how long? I can't afford to order till I get my income tax.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm unable to activate an upgrade that I purchased. After waiting on hold for too long for telephone support I opened a ticket on the website. A day later I received an email asking for the OS and machine info and the Activation code. Not a word since then.####$$##%NEGATIVE
wow so Rosetta stone is that helpful..?####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it is. Of course, you can always further immerse yourself via other sources.####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be great!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is the BEST language program I have every seen.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's how I feel with Japanese. I retain much more than I ever thought I would.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, I'm Brazilian if you're going to study "Brazilian Portuguese" I can help you :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow! Thank you for cheering for me! :) Debora, I will take you up on your offer. Just let me learn a couple of words first :) Rachel - I don't really count Russian since I was born into it. And I had to learn English when I moved to the States. Portuguese is half for work and half for fun. Italian is next and it will be just for fun :)####$$##%POSITIVE
That was so much fun!  I was the only person in the session, so she helped me to expand my sentences as I answered the questions.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Sean ! -- Dear Rachel, This is our tres week and we're still too shy to participate on-line. But I'm counting to 20, can introduce myself, know what clothes I'm wearing, my colors, and even know many of the verb forms. The photography is stunning. Before this experience I hadn't realized how VERY important the visual signals are. The artistic professionalism of the photographs is truly inspirational and is one of the motivations that keeps me clicking on that azul stone everyday.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love being the only one. You do get more help that way.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'll try to finish level 3 soon, because I'll be studying level 4 on my relatives to buy products or register for a majority of America does not sell in Thailand. I am very proud to have education.  ><' <3####$$##%POSITIVE

hi I have this programe but i dont know how install plz help me ty####$$##%NEGATIVE
cool thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I am Taiwanese. I am learning German with RS now. It is a lot of fun, and it is very efficient, too.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've heard horror stories... or that could just be German in general... there's a guy in class I know who's taken German. I can introduce you on Monday, if you'd like.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I am on German Level 5 now. It's a good program, but I'm really struggling with it.  I feel the grammar is lacking (German grammar is complex).    If you have resources to help you with grammar, you may do very well with RS German.  The RS folks will tell you that RS does teach grammar, but I'm the type who needs to understand why, and I do that by asking questions (and there isn't a real opportunity to ask questions on RS).  I will say that I've learned TONS of vocabulary and am understanding quite a bit.  Many users say they have no problem grasping the grammar part, so it may just be the way that I learn.  I hope you enjoy it and have much success.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm finishing up Level 2 and LOVE it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I went there last yr, isnt beautiful there?####$$##%POSITIVE
Loved it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Canadian French would be cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
Canadian French would be very cool. I'm planning on moving there.####$$##%POSITIVE
Danke!####$$##%POSITIVE
haha nice! just testing ya guys... thanks! I am going to learn how to better communicate with my girl from Korea. thanks to this amazing program life should be better soon between us!####$$##%POSITIVE
yes i have, it was very useful thankyou####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think you're going to speak fluently via RS.  RS is a good base, but you'll need to actually use the language and interact with people in German on a daily basis.  I'm on German Level 5 and am still struggling.  I've learned a lot of vocabulary, but after having taken 4 levels, I still don't think I'm anywhere near fluent.  The studio sessions help, as they are less scripted, but it's still very canned.  RS will help you learn the vocabulary, some sentence structure and limited grammar, but I can't imagine someone finishing the 5 levels and being considered fluent.  It's definitely not happening that way for me.  However, all that being said, I've learned TONS of vocabulary and am understanding much more now than I was at the beginning.####$$##%POSITIVE
I speak continental french and live near Quebec.  I don't think that there is enough of a difference to affect whether someone who learned one could not speak at the other place.  It's closer than some forms of American English, that's for sure.####$$##%POSITIVE
Then I think you'll be in good shape Leröne and RS is the tool for you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Appreciate it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I finished all 5 levels and it has really helped my confidence in speaking - even after 8 college classes in German! It helps that I know Germans (or people who have near-native fluency) that have helped.  RS is a good start, but you really have to use the language in order to speak it well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool, well thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too!  I have struggled beyond belief with German, but I'm amazed how I will hear words/phrases/sentences and actually understand what's being said. Not just in RS, but in songs/movies, etc. It's pretty cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
Even though I can read Japanese well there were moments where some parts did not make any sense. But they eventually did and I felt so much better when it started making sense.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got Japanese too. I love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's pretty cool. I've been stationed in Japan for a few years a while back, so I'm already a little familiar with the language a bit. I find it a bit challenging trying to recognize some the characters, but I'm still new to it. Hopefully, I'll be able to work through it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm struggling with answering your question, because it works and it doesn't work (at least for me).  I've only used Rosetta Stone for German and I find the process rather frustrating and I don't think I'm getting a full grasp on the language.  The grammar part is sorely lacking, but German grammar is much more difficult than Spanish.  I don't think it replaces a class with a good instructor, but if you want to be able to learn some basic words and put a few sentences together, you'll probably be happy.  Taking Rosetta Stone definitely helped me when I was in Germany recently, no doubt, but I am by no means fluent (and I just finished Level 4 out of the 5 levels).  Maybe I was expecting too much out of the program.  People keep encouraging me to continue, and I intend on finishing all 5 levels, but I really hoped to be able to think in German by the end of 4 levels and I'm not there... I'm still mentally translating everything, but I've learned a lot of vocabulary which has come in handy during my travels.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I finished level 5 of German and am in level 2 of Italian.  I plan to start Japanese with RS in December.  You ask if it works.  It does.  I do not use just RS, though.  I use RS as the framework and also use grammar books and speak to native speakers. I listen to music & videos in the languages, as well as read and write to pen pals.   I cannot imagine just using RS to learn a language.  I have taken college classes, but find that most are structured too much like other college subjects (like history and math) and do not emphasize speaking. Languages are a mode of communication, and you need to use it.  If you have people you can speak to in Spanish, it will help with fluency.  BY the way, it can take a while to really think in a language.  I learned to speak French and Spanish as a child.  Today, I was speaking Spanish and all of a sudden I could not remember the word for to have (tener) - the only word that came to mind was "avere" which is Italian. Once I said avere out loud, then tener came out, but I did get a strange look.   It does not happen often, but I know that it happens with other people who speak more than one language.  Also, to speak in a foreign language, there is always SKYPE.  It is a great way to be able to speak the language and help someone with their English.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thx####$$##%POSITIVE
better prices on ebay####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it is WELL worth it. It works like it's supposed to. And there is really no excuse for anyone who is "translating everything in their head." You would have to work really hard and TRY to do that with this type of program because it forces you to use the language DIRECTLY (as it should) in comprehensible contexts. It doesn't use another language in between. Inserting another language as a medium between the pictures and the target language you're acquiring is completely unnecessary and a lot of extra work that ends up hindering fluency; anyone using this program really has no excuse for doing that. Just use the program, relax, and begin building toward fluency in your new language!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm just got my set from Rosetta Stone.  I will be blogging my language journey :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Bonjour Lidia!  I took 4 years of French in high school.  I graduated in 1987.  Used it a TINY little bit (un petit peu) since then.  Bought Rosetta Stone (all 5 levels) in early Oct.  I love it so far!  It's already starting to get a little bit challenging for me.  I just completed level 1.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great! Thank you so much for your input....I'm really looking forward to buying! ####$$##%POSITIVE
I think your situation is a really good one for RS.  You'll remember much of what you forgot and the rusty parts will be shiny soon. Enjoy it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank u####$$##%POSITIVE
I took Spanish during the same time in school, but didn't take any college courses.  I started RS Spanish the other day.  I'm zipping through the lessons as I remember quite a bit.  A good refresher before getting to the higher levels.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank u! ####$$##%POSITIVE
ya im learning language l0llz.....####$$##%POSITIVE
Good choice.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree. I think the sessions are the funnest part. I love it when I'm reading a book, watching a movie or even playing a game and recognize the words used because of a lesson. It's happened in Pokemon and in a Japanese horror movie.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Bought it a couple of months ago, and I'm impressed!  Can't wait to be fluent!####$$##%POSITIVE
Alright thanks you guys i appreciate the help :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Very cool! :) good job and good luck to you!####$$##%POSITIVE
funny that they dont offer it any more seeing as they still advertise it on their website lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I was impressed. I am doing Swedish though :) Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
The CD course can be shared by five persons on one computer and even five on another.  However the monthly subscription for the online services is individual, per person.   Still, you can get a lot without the online feature.   If you buy the levels separately, you are ultimately going to pay a whole lot more money.####$$##%POSITIVE
QUE BUENO QUE ME RESPONDIERON RAPIDO MUCHAS GRACIAS ESTOY ANOTANDO####$$##%POSITIVE
..there is a great site called lifeprint.com that covers ASL####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have Version 3 so I'll look into the upgrade.  Thank you for your prompt response!####$$##%POSITIVE
I already speak quite a bit of Italian but not very well. I have a house in Italy and spend about 5 months of the year there, none of my neighbors speak any English so it's full Italian immersion when I go. I'd like to be able to communicate better with them and others I meet as well as take care of problems we encounter more easily.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, that's a good idea, I will give it a try. I am just tired of speaking like a 5 year old and want to sound more like an adult!####$$##%POSITIVE
Takk. I've sent my request!####$$##%POSITIVE
They have Payment Plans, thts how I was able to get it.####$$##%POSITIVE
so.... what language did you learn~####$$##%NEGATIVE
yeah, imma jap but im completey white-washed aha. my mom's too lazy to teach me and this is friggin expensive. i might go to japan again this summer, but i only know a few phrases here and there :P####$$##%POSITIVE
I speak some basic "mandarin" chinese, but I cannot afford to buy the Rosetta Stone lessons. It would help me so much in the job market to improve my 2nd language skills. I'm 60 yrs. old and have great international marketing experience. I need to take my mandarin to the next level but can't afford Rosetta Stone.   Is there not some special pricing or payment schedule for FB friends?####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have a 5 month payment plan, and I think today they are giving a discount but dont quote me on the discount.####$$##%POSITIVE
For the past few weeks I havent been motivated either, but then I feel the urge to do it, I havent even been in a studio session since last week.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Same here. I haven't done it in like a week because I'm even speaking just around the house (and confusing people yay!) and I had a little overload before soooo yeah####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just got in, people. I really enjoy the give and take. Just keep it going !!####$$##%POSITIVE
I dont know, I love it.  Its very interesting, and its quite easy for me because I know spanish and they are similars. ^^####$$##%POSITIVE
I finished all 5 levels of German and have more confidence to speak than I did before (am taking German at the university).  I am getting ready to start Japanese! Yeah!####$$##%POSITIVE
Love Rosetta stone I just started the $20/month online program and I love it####$$##%POSITIVE
I must say that his English was way better than my Spanish!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I'm currently using RS for Korean and Japanese. I love it so far. I'm still on the first level for both.####$$##%POSITIVE
tesekkular!! (thanks)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's clever, Thanks lots :)####$$##%POSITIVE
They don't really send out demo CDs too much anymore.  If you are interested in a certain language, they can send you a link for an extended demo. Most of the stuff that is on the demo is on the websites. I got a demo CD a while back (about 6 months ago), and it didn't have as much as is on the internet. (They are coasters now!)####$$##%NEGATIVE
My mom is interested in Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone: It is okay! Everybody has mix ups. Thanks for the link.####$$##%POSITIVE
Has anyone spotted any good "Black Friday" deals?####$$##%POSITIVE
kay I will go get Legolas####$$##%POSITIVE
I would rather learn from Elrond, he could tell some sweet stories####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to learn from Legolas. I've always considered it almost perfect to learn language from an attractive man.####$$##%POSITIVE
If Legolas is the teacher I'd have to learn. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Shainice! i got solution to install those language packs :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
When I asked the chat advisor ( who also, sadly misinformed me about payments) he said it was only available online. I'm in the uk if that makes a difference? Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was speaking to some Japanese people and they were surprised about how much Japanese I knew. I've been taking Rosetta Stone for the past 3 months now. They couldn't believe how much I knew.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been learning french for about 3 or 4 weeks and my husband and I can't believe how much I've already learned.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm not sure bout rosseta stone it's kinda expensive. I have total immersion and it's good.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah so far I am.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a great learning tool. What chapter/section are you up to?####$$##%POSITIVE
I used to be up to Level 2. But when they were offering Japanese for 20 a month, I decided to return the cd's and get the online version only. So now I've made it back up to Unit 2 of Level 1.For a college student the price was better.####$$##%POSITIVE
Huh... I had no idea they /had/ an online version. Damn. Thanks for sharing! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Lucky. You have more cash than I have, apparently. I wish Rosetta Stone would do some special pricing or payment schedules fgr for their FB friends.####$$##%NEGATIVE
its fun and interesting and i HIGHLY recommend it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Its pretty addictive####$$##%POSITIVE
Addictive, fun, and you learn without thinking about it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Very true. It's what I like about it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I took French in high school, but had no interest. Now, ten years later, I've started studying with RS. What used to be a labor I detested is now a daily activity. I love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
it is####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
use the pirate bay and get every thing for free dont waste cash####$$##%NEGATIVE
I guess I have to dish out the $800 it costs to buy all three levels brand new.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, I think youre the one thats boring.####$$##%POSITIVE
My first language is English, I also speak German, French and Spanish. I know how to read and write both Hebrew and Arabic but my vocab is low so I purchased the Hebrew levels 1-3. They are fantastic. My grandfather spoke 8 languages and my grandmother spoke 6, so I guess it was a gene I picked up. I do love it. I believe that if you learn a language, you will pretty much know the culture of the region you are studying. Then when you experience the region, it will all fall into place and make sense.####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Tamanna, Bernadette is 150% correct. Buy newspapers and magazines in the language you are learning.  Starting with the ads and classifieds, they are easy, short and repetitive.  Listening to music is also great as in our native language, we naturally memorize the words through hearing it over and over.  I did buy kids books in certain languages because that was the level I was at.  The best way to quickly learn a language is to go to the country where you have no choice but to pick it up as menus, signs are all in the native language.  That I love!There is a new ad from Rosetta Stone of 2 babies looking at a TV and watching as they hear and learn.  That is exactly how the courses are set up - as though we are 1 year old and learning a language for the first time.  Absolutely brilliant the way they mastered this.####$$##%POSITIVE
you will love this####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait. I'm using them for Japanese now. I went with Japanese first because I took it in college.####$$##%POSITIVE
(*SIGH*) But it's SO expensive!!!! :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok, if you say so! :) :D <3####$$##%POSITIVE
They always have a 5 payment plan without interest.  They may have a Black Friday deal.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool! :D I'll check it out!!! :) <3####$$##%POSITIVE
1. Because my family is from Portugal. 2. If that were the case, why do they have two English and two Spanish?####$$##%POSITIVE
My dad's close friend is from Iran and her native language is Farsi. He likes hearing her speak it and I guess saw a great deal on the program at the airport.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is possible to learn two languages at the same time no matter how different they may be.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that it is possible to learn two languages (or three!) at the same time.  It might be good to start one, get some basics, then start the next.  I started German, then Italian, and now I am starting Japanese.  I finished RS German (all 5 levels), and am taking more at the university level.  I am in Level 2 of Italian, and will start Japanese. You do need to use the languages - read, listen, expose yourself to it even at the beginning.####$$##%POSITIVE
When I was first learning languages, I was studying German, Dutch, Swedish and Danish one year, then Spanish, Portuguese, French the next, Korean, Japanese, Chinese after that....you get the point. But It's fun learning languages. I wish you success!####$$##%POSITIVE
so i should get, Rosetta Stone Arab and Rosetta Stone French at the same time?####$$##%POSITIVE
I got both Japanese and Korean. I'm waiting until I'm further in Japanese before I restart Korean. If you want to learn both at the same time, you should. You should go for it if that's what you want and you have the time for both.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's up to you. But don't stat them at the same time as Angel is saying. maybe after finishing Level 1, start the other language. Then alternate between the two languages as you progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing that, french and arabic at the same time. The spanish you know will make french a little easier to learn...####$$##%POSITIVE
I am doing turkish and ASL at the same time and it works well for me. It really is a personal thing if you find it confusing or distracting ofcourse you would want to get a good foundation started in one before spreading to the next. You know your limits and interests better than others so go with the flow and if it feels right do it.####$$##%POSITIVE
i love Russian! highly recommended!####$$##%POSITIVE
Kevin, deberías probar RS porque es una excelente aplicación de idiomas. Después de terminar todos los niveles podrías leer libros para mejorar tus conocimientos. Hago exactamente lo mismo.####$$##%POSITIVE
It works really great but if you buy direct from RS you have 6 months to try it out and return it if you aren't happy with it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do they teach you the alphabet first?####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes i sell Rosetta Stone its awesome it does work so many people are so cheap to buy the software when Nasa uses it one level is only $179.00 in you can pay it in 5 payments now####$$##%POSITIVE
yes you have a 6month guarantee return it used or unused for a full refund so you truly have nothing to lose in everything to gain a college Arabic class can costs thousands of your hard earn dollars in you might not even learn that much####$$##%POSITIVE
i've narrowed down to: Italian, German, Arabic, Russian, or Persian####$$##%POSITIVE
Arabic####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm thinking German, but I really wanted to try arabic, ah well.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing aribic I hope I can learn I'm not a fast learner####$$##%POSITIVE
Hai!! <3  Have you ever heard of JYJ?  check them out amazinggg! <3  and hot ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
that would be awsome!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ahhhhhhh Sweden, home of the blondes. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
he is awesome, after talking to several techs who were too busy trying to get off the phone, John FINALLY resolved the problem. Thank him for me!####$$##%POSITIVE
Who knows i might visit the country soon ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing Japanese too. Good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
I will help you in anyway I can. :) I love the Japanese language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Woot! imma do it for two 1 or 2 hrs everyday. So ill check in with u frm time to time, and discuss what ive learned =]####$$##%POSITIVE
Cheers Rachel, that i will, thnks for the support ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Jeniffer ur killn me here :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
がんばってね(ganbattene)-good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, do you ever get more than 3 games in solo?  There is never anyone on to play with.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the post Evelyn. I just checked and Barnes & Noble has same offer available.####$$##%POSITIVE
One of the reasons I love studio so much is that at higher levels you can continue to learn new words. Especially, for instance, after completing the entire course, you can continue to learn material outside the course.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys!  I'm just anxious to get started on some other languages, that's why I was asking.  I'll be getting the discs though.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought Italian, and then started a group class a couple of months later (got to the middle of Level 2) and skipped to the advanced group! Level 2 of Italian introduces future and past tenses, while level 1 introduces present.  RS gave me the basics and I still have 3 levels to go!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm waiting.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My question still isn't answered. Do I need to explain yet again?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was told that you will be changing the price of online access. I am still waiting. I am not going to pay for that expensive of a cost to use my product. Make it where you don't have to pay just so you can use your product like I have said and others have said time and time again. Fix it and make a happy customer. I gave y'all 500 bucks to buy it and i am not going to pay more every month or year to use it so u can get more money since that is obviously all you care about. FIX IT. NOW... Other than that, Rosetta stone is the best investment I have made. But for now it's the worst.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i'v started to use you just a week a go & im learning German super fast ! my friends said that they well definitely get you ! we just love you <3 <3 Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
:)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm asking, not critiquing####$$##%NEGATIVE
What the F? I didn't make an accusation, I hosted a question.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So if you want to talk about "Sweeping insinuation" maybe we should talk about YOUR's?####$$##%NEGATIVE
and what's with you posting the same response repeatedly anyways?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ben: You accused me of using "sweeping insinuations" which I don't appreciate####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's really interesting to see what a career linguist had to say: After completing the oral proficiency interview, this study participant commented:  “While  Rosetta Stone™ does teach a lot of words, they are not always the words you need to have an  actual conversation.” It is important to report that this person who persisted in the self-study of  Arabic was a career linguist who could already speak Korean, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese,  thus not the typical learner of interest to our clients, that is to say, someone embarking on the  initial study of a foreign language.  Also, have you read Table 3? It states "After completing the oral proficiency interview, this study participant commented:  “While  Rosetta Stone™ does teach a lot of words, they are not always the words you need to have an  actual conversation.” It is important to report that this person who persisted in the self-study of  Arabic was a career linguist who could already speak Korean, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese,  thus not the typical learner of interest to our clients, that is to say, someone embarking on the  initial study of a foreign language."  So....does this mean it's ok for [example] a beginner course but perhaps not for actually trying to communicate long-term with those in another country?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am only introducing data that YOU gave me :P####$$##%NEGATIVE
http://www.homeschoolreviews.com/reviews/curriculum/reviews.aspx?id=317 is about Rosetta Stone French...according to the link, it's not good for learning french####$$##%NEGATIVE
Donald: why don't you try language learning games online? there's plenty of ways to practice spanish outside of RS####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like my RS course; it has benefitted me; it is worth the price I paid. That's all I need to know. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Bought the Chinese a little sooner than I anticipated because of your cyber Monday deal.  Probably start to play with it after the first of the year.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, what you said is true....however, in everyday living in germany it helped me very little.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still poor ppl can't afford it...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes I was finally able to resolve the issue!! Thank you! Great program thus far.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yup. I'm doing Hebrew, but Rosetta Stone works. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I do feel the restriction on providing an email address to another Chat friend on the platform is over the  top. It's like "parental controls" on t.v. It could stem from a philosophy that mentioning any outside site or link might be with duplicitous intent, e.g. a competitor luring a user to other software. But alas, the restriction might also prevent true love between soul mates :)  I would appreciate it, Rachel, if my opinion as an end-user is reported to the owner or management. Thank you  for your time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Seriously!? Why didn't I think of that? Thanks, I'll go check there right now.####$$##%POSITIVE
Found them! Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Viktoriya - You'll love the studio sessions.  THey really reinforce what you have learned.  As you get further along, the coaches start asking you questions about yourself based on what you learned.  It is a great way to start speaking!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes... There are three games in my language. I thought games are available for all languages?####$$##%POSITIVE
Janice, I am looking forward to my first studio session next Sunday :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes.  You can do a studio for any particular unit as many times as you want/need.  You can only sign up for 2 sessions at a time, though, and not at the same level.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
All the best my man....Don't back up...!  I'm learning level 3 Portuguese, so I feel your pain...lLOL!####$$##%POSITIVE
I wouldn't consider that a normal wait. When I ordered I got my shipping information within 24 hours and I got the package in around three days. I would contact support. I did once place an order over the phone once and for some reason the order didn't go through.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm halfway through Japanese. I couldn't give up now. It was just the first time something like that happened. It was weird because I use the same headset every time. I got a Logitech and I haven't had this problem. Also kind of odd I've had the same teacher for almost every session with the exception today.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My last session wasn't good. I couldn't hear when she asked me questions. I haven't been back, because I keep putting it off.  Like you, I had good experiences with my other sessions.  I've concluded that all sessions can't be perfect. I will return soon.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had that problem with japanese studio sessions. I could not hear the coach and did not see her picture. She got support but it took up all the studio time. It was disappointing.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I hear an echo every time I have this one particular coach. And every time I go through the tech help rigmarole too. It's annoying. All the other coaches are fine, it is just this particular one. It is a shame, because she is a really good coach but when I have a studio session and I see it is this one particular coach, it makes me want to exit because of the technical issues.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just wish I had time to do more!!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
How far are you? I don't feel rushed yet.####$$##%POSITIVE
grazie molto... very helpful.. thank you all and happy holidays.. I'll start w/ Level 1.####$$##%POSITIVE
First lesson. It's going really fast. I can't talk that fast..####$$##%NEGATIVE
My teacher was faster than normal. I had to ask her to repeat many times. Sometimes I do have to make them repeat what they've said on RS. I've watched some shows in Japanese. On the shows I watch they don't typically speak as fast. But it was an anime so it may not count.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Rachel...I'm experiencing Brazilian Portuguese...I've already learned to speak some of the language while I was in Brazil, but I want to learn the grammar...I'm really happy with this....!####$$##%POSITIVE
But I think I understand what you're saying. Sometimes it does seem that the RS program speaks too fast.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh, I want to be able to speak many languages, but I can' t learn all of them at the same time. No offense, but I really don't want to learn a language based on if it's "useful" or not, I want to learn something I'm interested in. I don't plan on being somebody's tool, and I'll learn what I want to, whether it's following a global trend or not.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Rosetta Stone, I think I'll ask me teacher, maybe she can fix it. I'm talking about so-fast-I-think-there's-a-problem fast.     @ Everyone else: you guys are so understanding! ^-^####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Janice - just the kind of review I'm looking for  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I think my expectation is to be able to travel to a country, get around, meet people, speak with them, and learn more as I travel...a good base education that I can build on.####$$##%POSITIVE
What I don't expect is to become fluent in the language just from RS...I know that just won't happen  :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Have fun. I can't wait until I can do Chinese game nights. I should be ordering Mandarin this month. Trying to wait to see if there are any Christmas/end of the year deals.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, sometimes it wont let me finish the sentence and the program will make this sound, and the sound means that you got the sentence right, but its weird cause I didnt even finish the sentence.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey Sean, when you was learning a language the first couple of yrs or so, was you kind of nervous to speak to other people who spoke the language that you was learning? I am, I dont, I am kind of afraid to even go on some of the games and talk to other people.####$$##%NEGATIVE
An amazing use of photography for visual learning. I notice a big difference learning a language visually, matching new words/concepts to an image rather than translating to my native language. Images are clear. Some could use an update but overall very well done RS!!####$$##%POSITIVE
True it can be. I'm going to go back to two at the same time again.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is great, just put effort and time into it and you will see the difference####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it is! I'm learning Spanish and Latin via Rosetta Stone and little bits and pieces of Japanese. I'm also fluent in Mandarin and English.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing Japanese and Korean but I want to buy Mandarin. Maybe when I do I'll do Mandarin and german. I'm not sure yet.####$$##%POSITIVE
Love this program, just wish it would teach you to write also!!!! Jen####$$##%POSITIVE
I only have the online version.  The response I got from Rosetta Stone was that while they aren't academy standard spellings they are using them for pronunciation sake.  The problem is, even my five volume dictionary which has all of the nonstandard spellings doesn't contain the ones they are using.  If one were to spell that way in real life it would make them look ignorant, which wasn't my goal when I decided to pay for Rosetta Stone!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, it's changed now. Thank you####$$##%NEGATIVE
I sent her a message, and again, I was ignored :( I give up####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok, the issue I'm seeing is that I cannot even see the lessons.  For example if I click through 1-4 1 has my unit 2 information and unit 4 is blank.  I'm assuming this is a bug?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Got the email thank you for your prompt response. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have that happen sometime where I forget a word and remember it later. I can't wait for my studio session tonight. I need a good one so I can get back to it again.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
still a lot of money####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
i realize its no longer compatible with my upgraded OS as i tried to use it the other day. So now what? I spent $200 for the program and cant use it anymore?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just got my Russian RS today! Unfortunately, it will have to wait.  I am in level 2 of Italian and plan to start Japanese next week.  I know people in my town who speak both and are going to Italy and Japan, respectively,  to visit relatives during the holidays.  I want to know more when they get back so that I can actually speak to  them!  I finished 5 levels of German with RS, and am finishing my program in German at the university.  I have been conversationally fluent in Spanish and French for a few decades now.  Is there a support group for those of us who are addicted to languages?? :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Sean...that makes sense!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Janice!####$$##%POSITIVE
lol..Sometimes I think I should be in a support group because I am definitely addicted to languages. I love them. Most of my latest purchases have been language related.####$$##%POSITIVE
I hear you Angel. Languages are pretty much consuming all my free time, and since I'm self employed in the language business...that's 120% of the time :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thank you very much!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks man. I just enjoy what I do. I noticed in some of my posts, I seemed almost "bragging" about my abilities, and I do apologize for that.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Ikenna learning a romance language and an asian language was very challeging for me. The grammar rules are completley different between both of those languages!####$$##%POSITIVE
I was thinking about learning spanish and portuguese at the same time, but since those two languages are very similar to each other, I thought I should learn spanish first and then try portuguese.####$$##%POSITIVE
make that 58,126,214!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I don't think anything canmake it much easier. . .####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I'm also doing that next.####$$##%POSITIVE
not learning a new language yet but want to####$$##%POSITIVE
I did receive an outstanding offer from one of your associates though. No Tax, Free Shipping for Irish 1,2, & 3 for $387.40####$$##%POSITIVE
That makes sense - unless the parents want to learn as well as the children using the homeschool version. Thanks! Look forward to using the product. ####$$##%POSITIVE
i am learning german, and i also take the language in school and the two complement each other perfectly.the rosetta really helps me learn the language and cements concepts and words more strongly than my actual class####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I do live in the US....thank you so much for explaining that! That really clarified things for me. Thanks! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah rosetta get it right####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you!  I have 4+ years of German and I attend Alliance Francais for french, so I am very excited about Hebrew.####$$##%POSITIVE
Same here. I have Japanese but there are so many more languages I want to learn. So I  hope they have some more deals. The current one is ok but I do want to buy two at once. But that is a good gift and one of the languages I want to learn.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried the link above and I couldn't get it to work for me =(####$$##%NEGATIVE
It says error 1722 when I try both I have the completly online edition I have uninstalled the other one and used the guide. I also installed the adobe air edition it said to just to try and it wont work, now when I go onto my course the lessons dont load.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got it resolved!!! Thanks to technical support!! :) they were great!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the core lessons as well!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning German and it's brilliant! I'm so sold on Rosetta Stone. I tell pretty much everyone I know about how awesome it is, haha. :) Great product, though - really!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much I am going to search on the App store now and buy it right away! :) :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. Android please :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
There is already a free app for the iPad.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yep very good goal. I love the language and like Billy I don't think it's that hard.  @ Billy what other Asian languages do you speak?####$$##%POSITIVE
I was going to get the cd's but I already have recurring payments with RS for another year. I don't need to make anymore.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good luck and enjoy the journey!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Sean. That's a very good goal to have.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, Level 2, unit 2 Lesson 3 (I think), someone gives a watch as a gift. It's great in the other languages, but a serious faux pas for Chinese; it's homophonous with "the end," and is extremely rude. The language taught is excellent, the culture is taught exceedingly well in studio, but in the course these two images are rough.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is why it is probably not a good reason to use a generic frame for every language. . . . .####$$##%NEGATIVE
That is a valid point. I believe Rosetta Stone should make it a goal to have culture experts native to each language region for each language they offer to help customize each language version to appropriate cultural norms. I know they do something similar to this for their endangered languages, like some Native American languages, but they let the tribes do their own culturally relevant pictures and they in the end get to keep the software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They do hire native speakers, obviously, but they come in at the very end of the process.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Excellent response; however, not everything in language is universal either. The last lesson of level 5, for instance, teaches "front yard." this is very culturally biased, and the same number of screens could be used to teach something more universal and universally relevant. I will concede, however, that nowhere are the images Chinese people doing things that conflict strongly with Chinese culture, so you're safe there. And whatever complaints I have are minor enough that I'm still holding my breath for Arabic 4 & 5####$$##%POSITIVE
Not to mention Level 2 using American Christmas as a reference point for both gift-giving and time. Take Dutch for instance...Sinterklaas sails to the Netherlands from Spain sometime in November (no joke), and leaves gifts in your shoes on December 5. A lot of these cultural biases are pretty clearly not intentional choices based on thorough knowledge of culture.####$$##%POSITIVE
I thought so. Thanks for letting me know.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hmm... it still seems to crash.  Its usually after it goes through the log in that its wants to force close.  After I force close it once (and report the error) it has a higher chance of opening.  Usually after I get into the program, it works just fine.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do find it addictive. I'm hoping they eventually add level 4 & 5 to many languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Christy for your interest, but It's been 7 hours and I haven't received any emails, including a response from the ticket I submitted.  There really is nothing more to tell.  Everything has been working perfectly and now I cannot open the program.  I miss going in and studying a little every day.  I'm also afraid if I have to reinstall, I will lose everything that I have completed so far.  I took down the phone number, I will call in the morning, probably too late any more tonight.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, I was finally able to force quit RS and restart my computer.  Everything seems to be back on track.####$$##%POSITIVE
Very cool. I won Russian.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow...Good luck to you! I tried Mandarin and got absolutely confused... I am leaning Portuguese now, and I'd love to learn Italian. I also love Polish, so maybe some day :)####$$##%POSITIVE
My bf just bought me the french packet for xmas. But there are so many other languages Id like to learn. I Was using the package that the military got for their soldiers but they didn't sign back up for this year :( very disappointing. Especially for all of us in the middle of languages trying to get promotions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hawai'ian - there's a great language to learn. I should dust off my language book collection and see what I forgot I have. Good choice :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have problems when I write essays!!! what can I do??####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes...that´s true, even in their native languages...I always try to speak and chat with my english friends, I am glad when they tell me that they like my english, and I never can understand why my teachers don´t like my ideas, my essays,they always give me a non passing mark. That´s always make me feel bad, and without hope, not because of my efforts, but because of them, they will always be thinking the same apparently :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
gracias x las lindas palabras muchas gracias!!!thanks for your nice words!!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I´ll keep writing and working...<3 See you and thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried Rosaa games before they are cool,and u learn!!####$$##%POSITIVE

Thank you Rachel; this link was helpful. I have Italiano Levels 1 & 2 and have been looking forSupplemental Materials that I can carry with me. I've since noticed that you have Workbooks & Quizzes for home-schooled programs. Do you offer any supplemental materials for non-home-schooled programs? Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Its ok, thank you very much####$$##%POSITIVE
I was getting annoyed at first from listening to it cause I am only picking up tiny pieces of it, but now they are telling stories on the Cuban Station.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah, it can be frustrating listening to the radio because it is so much more advanced. I feel that way too sometimes. But I do catch things. And you can get used to hearing their intonation if nothing else. And the music can be enjoyable too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Always wanted to... another dream fulfilled.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been wanting to learn German since I was very little, as my bloodline on my father's side can be traced back to Bavaria as late as the 1770's. It's where my last name originated from. Unfortunately I can't afford Rosetta right now but I'm taking classes, and when I get Rosetta, I'll be very very excited!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I won Russian but I clicked the link and it just took me to RS.com no lesson to complete :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nice ####$$##%POSITIVE
That's good to know. I'm currently learning Japanese & Korean with RS. I love it so far.####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish and Swedish, thats a unique mix.####$$##%POSITIVE
The Swedish one is so fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
this is actually a pretty good idea!####$$##%POSITIVE
AWESOME####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been playing with it today! It is  LOT of fun!!  Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love it! Thanks, keep em coming!####$$##%POSITIVE
Can you please make this game available for japanese? I love playing this game in italian.####$$##%POSITIVE
This is an excellent game for practicing oral vocabulary retrieval and sentence building with pattern drills. An important addition to the Rosetta Stone games! (Playing by myself, I was at first puzzled by what that blue shovel was doing. It's your virtual opponent in the game, named R___ Stone, not a real person. You can pretty much ignore it.)####$$##%POSITIVE
My wife bought Mandarin for me and the children so the whole family can speak the language. I'm at Unit 1 core lesson, and using the alphabet option down there. Can't imagine using those Chinese letters, though!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the program too.  Right now I'm doing Japanese. I was going to do two languages at once but have decided to give one language my complete time and dedication. Early next year I will go back to Korean.  I'm planning to use it for Mandarin eventually too. I love Asian languages and culture.####$$##%POSITIVE
Lisa, I think you have it right.  I can also tell you that later you will start to pick out individual words and understand them in multiple different phrases within the course.   Think about a baby for a moment to understand why this works.   A baby will utter sentences that might even be completely incomprehensible, less so to the babies mother.  Over time, the baby starts getting what it wants (punctuated by screams of frustration when it doesn't), and as the baby starts getting what it wants, it's sentences become clearer, more complicated but at the beginning, they are imitating what they hear and not "translating".   RS learning theory attempts to re-create that process as much as possible or likewise how someone learns if they just end up in a country and just learn as they go.   Consider the sad story of Amanda Knox, falsely imprisoned in Italy after a few weeks there, when she finally spoke in court her italian was perfect.  I doubt she had any lessons.   RS is thousands of times easier than her learning method but ultimately the same and the same as a baby (stuck in an italian prison) ... with these comparisons RS really is great as a compromise :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
It was a pleasure for me to share, looking forward to do more !####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too Sofiane.    I am still thinking of what was a very wonderful evening.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it really was ! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, trying it NOW :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Love it. Just worried about the speaking.... Can understand by listening easier than I can to say!####$$##%POSITIVE
im working on level one but i have a hard time putting together sentences####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Angel. Rachel, is there something I can be doing to assist me in learning the process?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes,by the way its amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
its been good, although learning spanish and latin at the same time is hard its progressing####$$##%POSITIVE
I used it for learning Japanese. I find your format to be impeccably useful and as close to the natural way of learning a language as possible. I would recommend it to anyone.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think it does. It has helped me a lot with Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
God yes!!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm trying to learn the Cherokee language..I'm in Tennessee,And about 30 miles from the Eastern Band in North Carolina.Hard to learn,But beautiful!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the good news! Sounds like a good Xmas to myself!####$$##%POSITIVE
please man,  I tried since 2010, they will never do it.  I got me a copy from other friend,,,   what I hate is their "free fake adverised (free copy etc)" and never gets done"   so there.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I called in to get mine.. It took two weeks to get here####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think that that's the problem because I don't have any issues with any of the other programs that I run. The problem usually occurs when I first log on and after I finish a lesson. I get the message "Syncing Rosetta Course Progress," and it takes a long time to go to the home page or to another lesson. During lessons, it runs fine.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for your response.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sean good luck####$$##%POSITIVE
A couple of things. 1) reading comprehension: the "study" claims that RS is *not* as good as its competition, however: 2) It is not an actual study, it was not published in an actual journal, and it's actually a thinly veiled advertisement, and is completely disingenuous.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Farsi as well####$$##%POSITIVE
I paid $300.00 for a single level here####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have payment plans, and plus it was $300 more last year, so they knocked the price down alot.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the same problem.. Only I'm learning Russian haha####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have payment plans with 0% interest, and compared to a college class or a private tutor, it is much cheaper.####$$##%POSITIVE
yikes! well good luck in your endeavors! if i was learning it id play games with you haha!####$$##%POSITIVE
179$ is the best package!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the same problem with Japanese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with Chad. If it was cheaper, people of lower incomes. Could use it to raise there incomes, to obtain a better job.  But, you wouldnt want them to raise above themselves.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the help! It's very much appreciated.####$$##%POSITIVE
it was very funny####$$##%POSITIVE
True, but working full time and/or attending school full time like most my age (early twenties) it's hard to find the time and cash at once in order to even give it a shot. There's a lot that could be said about this and there really isn't a "good" or "right" answer. All I'm saying is: they should follow closer to the supply and demand factors. The cheaper it is the higher the demand. After being out for this long it should drop in prices around $100-150 not $200, at the cheapest. I don't shop online because I'm not comfortable putting my info out there and I think they should keep that in mind for other like that####$$##%NEGATIVE
They expend a lot of money in order to get the product that way it is, and to have tech support and the services that they offer, that costs money too.  Also, there are a lot of ways to shop online.  I say save for it, use the payment plan, or just wait for a deal.  If the prices got too low, it would not be the product that it is.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been doing the Spanish course online and I think it's great.####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome! i just put it in thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I pay $20 a month and have all levels unlocked online :) it's great!####$$##%POSITIVE
Sue- go LA Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
crann Nollag  And btw Nichole Martin, pretty lame.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the description. Now I see it's basically beat-the-clock. Very good idea in trying to force fluency! Great idea from whomever developed this game (please pass along to your r&d)!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have RS for German, and it works great at starting you off. Although, I don't think it truly makes you 100% fluent, you will, for the most part, be able to Speak your mind and tell what you're feeling and ask questions. The only way to actually get 100% fluent is to live in the actually country. But I really do recommend RS, it's a great product.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been using RS for Japanese, and the program works great learning how to say everything. However, I believe the program works best as only a part of a complete study tool kit. I believe a good japanese textbook (Genki series), a college class, and a copy of RS would be great. In my experience and others around me, RS by itself will not make you fluent.####$$##%POSITIVE
He is giving a great overview of the program, and yes I did pick up a few tips.####$$##%POSITIVE
Honestly, just something new.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm a customer who has Rosetta French Levels 1-5 and I would love to get another Rosetta to give as a gift.  I didn't get the offer ... in fact, I think I haven't gotten any offers since installing Rosetta.  How can I get on the special offer list?####$$##%POSITIVE
student on a tight budget that saved up for this, then come to find out I coulda gotten it for almost 1/2 the price. I'd love to buy several, but one was pricey enough. thx anyway.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks so it takes more then Rosetta to become fluent but its better to get Rosetta then to go to a class.. i like this####$$##%POSITIVE
If I am not misinformed, the US Military uses RS. Can you imagine being in Special Forces and learning 20 languages or more? I have heard that RS is the best way to learn a language. Good luck and have fun :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for correcting me. But they did use it successfully so it must be a good product. ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
waow Thanks to you all!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
You are going to love it?####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried it first time last night, was up till twelve, I do live. Amazing, I can already feel the conections between the sound sand images being established in ym thinking.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello Alex, Here is Joana from Brazil. My brother bought me Rosetta Stone set online in the  USA and I received it 2 days ago. My pro9blem is: I cannot activate the product, the error number is 8118. What can I do? I do not even know what this number means! Thanks a lot!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ohh thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I still have not received a message. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I posted a similar question on the Rosetta Stone Spanish Facebook page.  They gave a good answer there.  I posted a screen shot with it, so maybe it will be easy to find.####$$##%POSITIVE
i luv it its fun####$$##%POSITIVE
Good for you!  Studio Sessions are really the only place you'll get corrected, unless you have other people who speak the language you're learning.  Keep attending and it will improve.####$$##%POSITIVE
They have payment plans to make it affordable####$$##%POSITIVE
payment plans don't make it more affordable, they make you go into debt.... saving up ahead of time can help####$$##%NEGATIVE
0% interest is good for interest, but it's still debt####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's affordable considering how much it would cost to take college courses that compare to RS.  If you want something that's $50, you can get a book that you have to figure it all out.     If this program ever got that cheap I'd be worried about what was removed and no longer offered.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Telling me why it's expensive doesn't change the fact that it's expensive. The company should also realize that they'd make a profit by lowering the price, considering that more people would be able to afford it. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Unfortunately, the Ukrainian People are not given software we need as you Russian speakers are.  Rosetta Stone does not care about the Ukrainian Language as they do the Russian Language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well I learned something new! Thank you! I was wondering about that myself####$$##%POSITIVE
The Italian course is awesome! Enjoy!~####$$##%POSITIVE
It helps but you have to be determined####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Everyone is so helpful !!!! What a great group !!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing Hebrew now, and it works. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
its just a fact yo!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Failure!!!!!!!     :D####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the response.  Perhaps you could consider that option for future versions.  It would be very handy to be able to access the student progress reports from one central computer even if the students are using different laptops to complete the work.####$$##%POSITIVE
promoting something expensive as $300 off last year means absolutely nothing to me other than you jacked the price up so much last year you could come down on it $300. not the best sales tactic. just makes me want to wait another year to buy it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's only about $50 off current. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
When I called in for customer support. I spent 3.5 hours on the phone and talked with 5 different people. My version 3 of the software would not reinstall.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You are an inspiration for me.  I will be starting Italian. Keep up the good work.####$$##%POSITIVE
It was great!####$$##%POSITIVE
i am in french level 1 lesson 3 now... can't wait.. thanks for the inspiration####$$##%POSITIVE
sure I also want to tell everybody that I learned English with Rosetta Stone and that my goal for next year is to be fluent in German and thanks to Rosetta Stone thats totally possible####$$##%POSITIVE
havent got it yet####$$##%NEGATIVE
The single sessions are the best. I learn so much more####$$##%POSITIVE
I had the same problem with the Hindi prize... :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not a big deal.  Thanks for checking into it.  I'll wait to buy the complete package of the language I want to learn over this.  Thanks again.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thank you! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I want to try it and question  ٌhow do you get the app on totale for the iPhone####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello can i Talk to someone####$$##%NEGATIVE
she's so luckyy####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah I love it, I have Latin American Spanish and I am getting better, the only thing that would make it better is if I can move someplace where there is more speakers.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ciao####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm sure they can, but they won't.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much. and I will. that sad you filofina and dont know it. which is me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Will do :) thanks so much.####$$##%POSITIVE
why is it so expensive?####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's too expensive, with that money, I could take two semesters of a language class and learn from there####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is worth the price it asks.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is money well spent!  I am learning German, using it everyday and love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
It is worth it and they are offering a monthly payment plan. It's an investment for personal enrichment. Also, you should check with your company but many business will help in the costs towards making their employees bi-lingual. It's a documented fact that bi-lingual employees make more money as well. I ordered Spanish and my boss is going 50/50 in with me.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is expensive because it is more than you get in a classroom and individualized.  I don't know where you live, but in most US cities, you cannot get 2 semesters of a language for the price that RS costs.  Between tuition, books, and travel, it is way more, and most schools treat a language like history, or math - not as a mode of communication.  so many people complain about the price but really do not know anything about the product.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have already enquired there. But I get none answer...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Kim's question is not fully answered. And since my previous post was deleted, it still remains unanswered.####$$##%NEGATIVE
And that's the kind of information needed to answer a question. Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Editing my post for clarity: I'm studying Japanese and I feel like I'm doing pretty well. I know a Japanese native who works as a translator and she's impressed with my progress. I'm going slowly, but thoroughly. My recommendation is to learn the Hiragana (phonetic alphabet) first then do all of your lessons in that instead of Romanji. In retrospect, I wish I'd started that way. For learning Hiragana, I recommend Dr. Moku's Hiragana Mnemonics. Rosetta Stone does seem like an effective way to learn the basics of Japanese. I would recommend some other supplementary materials, but I think it does a good job of laying a foundation. Plus it's fun. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
There are many programs which teach languages well to certain people, but only one program that benefits almost everyone who uses it: Rosetta Stone works. The rest is up to you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I saw it came up last night. Thanks for taking care of it. Most unfortunate timing, sadly.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks. I'll check it out!####$$##%POSITIVE
Between the two, I'd rather go for Rosetta Stone. Pimsleur is good, but it won't help you with conversational needs, plus it's just CDs and an audio transcript - no studio sessions or games, etc. Transparent Language is also trying to compare themselves with RS (West Point Military compared the two), but can't quite get it either.####$$##%POSITIVE
I personally like RS better, but RS does use similar exercises to pinsleur, but I like to see and to interact better than listening.####$$##%POSITIVE
I use both Pimsleur and RS. I actually found out about Pimsleur before I found out about RS. It did give me a few words that I was able to use before my first day of class. It's at most libraries. I did finish their Japanese course.   Until I came to this Facebook page I never thought of RS and Pimsleur as competition. Pimsleur is audio only and I like to listen on my IPOD when I'm going places or cleaning my room. While RS I use when I'm at home. I always thought they were too different to be competition. I do prefer RS because of the games and sessions. Pimsleur doesn't have the option  to make connections and play games.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS. No question.####$$##%POSITIVE
I wish I could afford this program####$$##%NEGATIVE
I use both RS and Pimsleur as well.  Pimsleur is EXCELLENT for conversational ability.  It forces you to speak, a lot.  My pronunciation really became strong.  Each Level is divided into thirty, thirty minutes lessons.  Like RS's audio companion, you can use it while you do other activities such as cleaning the house.  I noticed a huge difference in Studio after I began using Pimsleur.  It is a great supplement to RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think Rosetta Stone is a terrific service that enables people to easily learn new languages. Read a great post about it here - http://www.delhiplanet.com/index.php/2011/12/12/how-to-beat-language-barrier-rosetta-stone-wordlens-facebook/####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, I think that they use the same person for the RS audio companion that they use for Pimsleur! Actually, it was THE learning method years ago when I studied languages, so I have quite a few language packages.  I believe that RS is better, overall, because it is more interactive and geared to higher level conversation.  I agree that it can be a good supplement to RS - it is always good to have extra instruction.####$$##%POSITIVE
There is also another cheaper language program called Rocket Languages.  I have it and have been using it-its contemporary and fast. I'm almost done with level 1 and now may be able to buy RS, so would be curious to see where I would fit on RS.  Rocket is also online, many languages, but doesn't have speaking studio version though you can online communicate.####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't see it####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do love it far more than I thought I would have.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes it would be the smartest thing you can do for your son purchase this your life as well as his will change for the better, learn the language along with him, or a foreign one to yourself, good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
Killer, thx####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning German and as I have no job since I ship in the Navy in October, I have been studying German for the future. I study about 5-8 hours a day and I have been learning a lot. I usually go back to a lesson after I do it once to pick up on things that I've missed and to touch up on things I know. It's an amazing program.####$$##%POSITIVE
This is very helpful, thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am almost done wiith Level 2 Unit 2 japanese. The lessons are interesting.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, day 1...so far so good.  My pronunciation is decidedly South American:-)   It is odd not to have any background in a language, like Swedish, so every word is completely new to me.  I signed up for Studio in ten days.  Without a doubt there aren't nearly the Studio sessions offered as there are in Spanish but I expected that.  I will let you know how the progress goes.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think the app for the ipad is awesome although I don't have it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have an iPod touch and it is fantastic. I practice pronunciation and review vocabulary. Have you downloaded it yet?####$$##%POSITIVE
Have the i-phone app and it works wonderfully. Does not contain games though.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes....I am.:)  I still have to buy the other levels, finished level 1 but i don`t have the others yet....Are you having fun?####$$##%POSITIVE
Yay!! I did all of core lessons 1 and then did it all over again..i will spend the next fews days reviewing before i move on to core lessons2..love the memo game!####$$##%POSITIVE
GOOD JOB!####$$##%POSITIVE
Buy a cheaper program ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the help Jennifer.  Unfortunately its not a tech issue its an upgrade issue.  It's confirmed Ver. 2 is a PowerPC program and this will not be supported in the new version of Mac OSX.  I have been told the solution is to re purchase the complete program.  I find this hard to swallow and was thinking someone else might have had a similar issue that could help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Taylor, yes Ver. 2.2.  I purchased it about 5 years ago when I took on a new job and wanted to learn Spanish for the Job.  The need wained but lately have had the desire to pick it up again.  A little research showed that I may loose that ability.  Just looking for options to allow me to continue to use the software.  Many other companies have updated software to run on recent OS, and they cost much less than Rosetta.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm really loving french. Just having a hard time to find people online to play the games and to build conections. :( what time usually you guys are online?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Really?  Did you do what they said?  Sorry to hear.  I was wanting to get it.  I guess taking classes at the local community college is cheaper.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have to completely disagree - I'll never take classes ever again because of how effective Rosetta Stone has been, in my experience and because it is cheaper.  My Spanish is far better now than it was before I started RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ｎicole; It's fantastic. The course is immensely helpful, the games in world can really boost your vocabulary if you're paying attention, and the studio sessions are work the entire cost of the course, no doubt. An hour of chatting with (and corrections from) native speakers, unlimited within the timeframe for your subscription (It's something like $100 to make it a full year), is absolutely priceless.####$$##%POSITIVE
Personally, I really like the CD product because you'll have the Course work forever - more or less its yours to keep and it is all on your hard drive - no CDs needed after installation.  Now, if you want the online version because you do not have a CD drive, RS tech support can help you there.  So, I feel the better deal is in the CD product but if you have a specif situation where that can't work, go for the online version.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like how the online version has all levels.####$$##%POSITIVE
I definitely recommend the actual software, but as you understood what I wrote you'll likely find studio the most useful, but I guarantee there'll be some good review in the course. L2 has the 把 structure, L3 has 'double 了' among other things. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I am thinking of buying German for my 14 yr old who wants to learn but I don't know if he will stick with it. The video game are his priority right now that school is out. How many levels do you think I should get?####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes.  I started the course on my main computer, then downloaded the iPad App.  They are not syncing (even though it says "syncing" when you open the program).  The main computer also has a bizarre message cn_path_type_unspecified.  I am calling them now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Geoffrey - Thank you - I did check  that.  Alex - I ended up clicking on the correct level, and manually started where I was.  When I shut the Rosetta Stone down, and re-started, it went to the correct spot.  I don't know what the issue was.  I have Windows 7.  I ended  up hanging up on customer service after on hold for 20.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks, just placed my order and with the payment plan it is extremely reasonable with the payment plan####$$##%POSITIVE
It actually isn't high priced.  Compare it with a college course in the amount of time it takes and the cost.  CD only courses rarely work without a classroom most people fail.  So you have something that works, takes less time and is less expensive than other things which work.####$$##%POSITIVE
Mi piace!####$$##%POSITIVE
I began learning German last Fall and just spent 3 weeks in Germany and Austria.  People there were amazed at how much I could speak in such a short time.  I didn't think I knew much, but they were impressed.  Cool.  Thanks, Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
I still find myself "translating" but not as much.  I'm hoping I will just "snap" one day and not have to translate any more.  LOL  I also am noticing that the speech is getting much quicker and I'm understanding it fairly easily.####$$##%POSITIVE
I learned Italian with rosetta stone and I will try to study all the languages. I love Studio! I hope to study in France during summer 2012.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hooray!####$$##%POSITIVE
Great, thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am currently learning japanese(for  about 3 months) with RS. It has been great. Have fun learning japanese! We can play together in Rosetta World one day!####$$##%POSITIVE
Alright! I'll look forward to it!####$$##%POSITIVE
That's great and thank you for your service!  Have you also been learning the alphabet?  I imagine that is useful for road signs, shop signs etc. ?   Do you have nationals you can spend time with and practice?   I'm just curious about how language learning mixes in with your service.####$$##%POSITIVE
well to geoffrey. no i dont come into contact with them much but the terps speak with them. but i over hear and i know pretty much what is being said to an extent. its the best decision ive made to take this language. and to sarah, i like how i can switch from a male or female voice. the 2 pronounce words differently and if u mes it up it can mean something totally diff. so thanks again rosetta stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
ok cool. yes maam i will be glad to share it. i will do it as soon as i have the time####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your service!   I have found the same thing. That RS is better than typical high school classes, especially entering into the language. I took French to refresh what I learned in HS.  I've taken the Arabic myself and I really enjoy it.  I just bought a text book so I can go further into Arabic than RS provides.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everybody. It's a good start to help me find my favorites!####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning how to read and write in another language####$$##%POSITIVE
Good idea!  I have my Facebook in Hindi, but I hadn't thought to maybe follow some people on twitter who write in Hindi####$$##%POSITIVE
Great idea!####$$##%POSITIVE

Thanks for the amazingly fast reply. I will check this out. BTW, watched the video of how to speak like a pirate and shared. Hilarious!####$$##%POSITIVE
I was not given the option to save my files before I was lead throught the uninstal process####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Geoffrey-love all your comments you are a no no nonsense kind of guy straight forward,very awesome, thank you for you advice look forward to reading more of your comments!! @ Matt-lol!!! I always have spoken Spanish and English so it was easy for me but i could see someone new to it stumbling over those to words, and i will stick with it i love a challenge!! Rosetta Stone-i will change the settings asap!! Thanks everyone!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have tried to go to the US site and to the UK site but it automatically redirects me to the German site.  I am an English speaker wishing to study French, so being forced to a German language site doesn't work for me.  It's the automatic web redirect (which I can not cancel) that is ruining it for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you both! in core lesson 2 they do use it with an h but there is a y before the h so that makes since why i could not look it up..again thank you both! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I used the payment option, then my dog ate the instalation disk...?  wtf?####$$##%NEGATIVE
No $450.00 is not an unreasonable price. Now I ask. Is that all inclusive?####$$##%NEGATIVE
And again I ask. Is it truely only $450.00 and all inclusive? Simple question. Simple answer please.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh for goodnes sake. How much? Total. No fine print. Can't SOMEONE answer that Q?####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes and yes####$$##%POSITIVE
By the way - I uninstalled Dell Data Safe because I read that program could interfere with RS.  But the error continues...####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you very much! i was thinking i would do all of a unit before i tried a studio session. just so i am some what ready and comfortable..:)####$$##%POSITIVE
wow!! thanks everyone!!####$$##%POSITIVE
excellent feedback. thanks geoffrey!####$$##%POSITIVE
rosetta stone works!####$$##%POSITIVE
Phew! Well that was an experience. Quite daunting at times as you try to figure out what the reply to the question is.. or indeed having to pose a question to someone else! However the instructor was very patient and helpful throughout and the other attendees were obviously all in the same boat and no doubt feeling exactly the same. In short.. nerve-wracking but enjoyable! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
No, I really don't have access to earlier levels. My levels 1-4 were version 3, until I bought level 5 version 4 TOTALe and upgraded everything to TOTALe, but I've tried several times to schedule earlier level studio sessions without success.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I also notice that it says that the lesson is still 'in progress'.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Too expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You mean with the tutor? Yes. Though why are they teaching us -me - the wrong thing in the first place? If it was right, then the tutors wouldn't have to correct us. Makes me wonder what else is wrong. Not that I have anything against it or anything. It's a lovely program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Candace, this program is AMAZING.  I love it so much! I'm learning Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. <3####$$##%POSITIVE
I ordered the french program 1 - 3 last night from RosettaStone.com####$$##%POSITIVE

I've just finished Level 1 and now starting Level 2.  I'm planning on visiting for Oktoberfest 2012.  I'm sure I'll be ready by then thanks to Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
i wish I had rosetta stone so i could play!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Just start using it, it's a lot of fun.####$$##%POSITIVE

Aside from my own reasons for wanting to continue learning Khmer, I feel it would be a huge financial and public relations success for Rosetta Stone to develop such a program, as many second-and-third generation Cambodian-American refugees don't speak Khmer.  In a culture where the first generation refugees devoted their efforts to having their children learn English (only being taught little more Khmer than needed to translate medical and legal forms), and the third generation having few family members who know the full range of their mother language, what could be more fundimentally positive and financially successful -- with a people whose culture was ripped asunder by genocide and forced to forget the knowledge of there heritage -- than developing a world-class Khmer program when there are millions of people who want to learn but only a few hundred teachers?  I've filed the proper form, but in addition, I implore you to consider the benefits of aquiescing to it.  Once again, thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome! Your English seems to be very good!  I'm currently learning Spanish so hopefully I get as good at my Spanish as you are in English! : )####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you matt! So you're learning spanish, good luck with that, if you do your best you'll be good for sure :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the info appreciate it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't like it. I'm tired of "pressing 1" for English, too. I think it is important to learn other languages and I love Rosetta Stone. I AM tired of having trouble communicating in my native language in my home land. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the quick reply! I tried the demo after posting the previous comment - it was quite fun! So how does the mobile companion work in conjunction? I'm going away in 5 months & need to learn as much as possible!####$$##%POSITIVE
Looks really good! Is the TOTALe discs just the latest versions? Are there any deals on them atm if I buy all 5 levels at once? When I last looked they were £289 or something? Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Simy, I've just bought the set so will see you very soon!####$$##%POSITIVE
how do you unlike rosetta stone?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have the same problem, AKO is jacked up and can't use great benefits like Rosetta. It's a real bummer.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As far as your Mac, it should be fine (though screen size is not important)  I use Rosetta Stone for Spanish and I LOVE IT!! Worth every dime and penny! Buy it! It's amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
Additionally, I wanted to get a certificate in Italian.  After weighing the financial issues and the experience with RS, I decided that I would just buy the five levels of RS and get proficient in Italian through study with RS, and the local Italian meetups.  Also, if your main goal is to become conversant in German, RS is the way to go, because between the course, and the studio sessions (with native speaker teachers), you will become conversant in German.  Think of the $480 as an investment in yourself and in your dreams. College courses (tuition, books, gas, and incidentals) will cost you more than $480.  Consider that there is a payment plan (over 5 months) and a 6-month money-back guarantee (no questions asked), and this is a good product.####$$##%POSITIVE
One last comment - I found that studying on your own is great for a while, but you need that push, and you need support.  RS can give you that. There is a section on their website with transcripts of the course.  Look at the one in English as the German will pretty much parallel that.  Also, do a demo of German, and look at the informational videos.  I have always loved languages, and am glad that a product like RS is around.  I can now do something that I wanted to as a child in the 60s and 70s - study languages in depth at my leisure.  Add internet resources (videos, newspapers, SKYPE, etc), and the stage is set for proficiency in almost any language in the world.####$$##%POSITIVE
It works, I've learned two languages.   it takes less time to learn than in a classroom, its cheaper than a classroom.  However, you have to put in real time to learn a language and that's the real investment.  If you invest the time, you will learn German well.  If you don't, obviously its worthless.   However, if you buy direct from RS and return it within six months, you get all your money back.   Decide for yourself, that's plenty of time to find out.    You should plan on a minimum of 4 hours a week and 1/2 hour a day.   Each level takes about 40 hours then there is review and work with online coaches.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you all for your responses, I've made up my mind and will give them a try.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the german program, It is the best program i have ever used.  EVER.  I learn so much more then i would have ever thought.  GETT ITT>####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice Rosetta Stone. Way to kill the culture of USA. You strive to teach languages to other people which gets them to accept a certain culture, but when it comes to Hisanics coming here you expect US to learn THEIR culture and language??? It's like inviting someone to your house and following their customs. You guys should be selling them American Rosetta Stone. Not the other way around.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Can't wait to get my copy of Rosetta Stone. I'm learning French!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am working on Italian also, just finished all the Level 1 Units. I'm using the RS online Totale, I think is a great value for the $$, if you have the time to dedicate to it. You can do a 3 mo or 6 mo commitment. I have been using it for a month and I am really pleased with my progress and the service.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanls for help####$$##%POSITIVE
i cant find anywhere on the website mentioning the payment plan####$$##%NEGATIVE
can u make rosetta stone more user friendly?i mean, why give some english translation of the words.. to make it more easier to understand, as a beginner, i find it very difficult, stressful because i need to guess all the words at the start.. it boring. im so sorry..####$$##%NEGATIVE
i use the iPad app a lot and really love it (even though I am patiently -sort of- waiting for more features such as unlocking writing, milestones and rosetta world.  iPad was essential when I travelled for a week.  It is certainly a beautiful app. I know I will need to extend the subscription (a bit irritating, but worth it).####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank u everyone! ####$$##%POSITIVE
LOL...me too!  That is still my favorite!####$$##%POSITIVE
I got an email from tech support titled with my second problem, but addressing my first problem.  Unfortunately, I cannot do anything about the first problem until the second one is resolved.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, everyone! I have made up my mind to go ahead with the CD-ROM. Thanks for all your help and advice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Haven't received it yet! Only just ordered it today. Someone has alredy got back to me though, thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for serving!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think Latin american spanish is more global than spanish from spain. I take latin american spanish using rosetta stone. It's fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hope you join the RS learners team soon:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the info. I have learned that the Japanese have higher standers then the US. I do know of a school in Japan I would love to attend. For more immersion into the language and culture.  I went to Japan in 05 and ever since have wanted to go back and live there. If I could teach or not. As long as I were able to speak the language, I know that as long as I am at least at conversation level that I would be able to get a job to support myself.  I have been looking into it already.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning japanese with RS. With RS, you will converse more in a variety of topics.  Currently, I am in Level 2. Today, I learn  little business terms. Also, I learn some new words that will help me to ask "are you going to my party?" "I am busy today" and" Are you a great dancer?" Before RS, I have no background in japanese. All I ever had was a dream to go visit Japan one day. Three months later, I am already conversing with natives in most topics(except politics). I hope this helps.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes i totaly agree! here in mexico sold by $8000-14000 pesos... is so expensive.... this product have so much potencial if only more people and student can use... nobody know this progam in my city!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Have you really experienced Rosetta Stone?  You get what you pay for, and for the price of RS you get speech recognition that corrects your pronunciation, extended vocabulary/grammar/pronunciation/writing exercises as well as classes with native speakers, online games with other learners and native speakers of your target language.  For the price, it is cheaper than a college class and you can go on your own pace and it is individualized.  If each level were $50, you would get none of this - just look at what you get for $50 on other products.  If you want it, look into the 5 payment plan.  But this is NOT an expensive program for what you get.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree and I kind of do not agree. I think that if you want the physical product, it is okay to charge what they are charging, but I think there should be an online version that they could charge less for. I think that would be a bit more fair, and I believe many more people would actually pay for the product. I know many people who would like to use Rosette Stone, but refuse to spend that much money for it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! We both had a good laugh. I said to her, "Too much time listening to Spanish lesson CD's."####$$##%POSITIVE
Every once in a while I say something very unexpected to my Puerto Rican husband and it really startles him. We always have a great laugh.......####$$##%POSITIVE
Worth EVERY dime! : )####$$##%POSITIVE
I am currently learning japanese with RS. It's fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both for your responses. I will reschedule and try try again. I'm glad to see that it's not just me! :) Does it help to write out a cheat sheet of vocabulary or will that just hinder the process?####$$##%POSITIVE
Michelle, hang in there.   I had the same experience my first few times doing Studio sessions.   I just couldn't think of words that I had gone over earlier in the day! I found a glass of wine works better than a cheat sheet :-)   Don't tell RS....####$$##%POSITIVE
:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow I just saw you guys now have a payment plan! Awesome.  I may just get it for now for me and then use it for my daughter when she is able... But still my question is how young can you start the homeschooling version of rosetta Stone?  My almost 3 year old can already navigate the computer and did very well with her PBS Kids DVD and the Little Pim game by herself...####$$##%POSITIVE
What is Rosetta World and Rosetta Studio?  And what is the age limits for those?  I think foreign language is important at a  young age so I will probably have her work on my lap.  I'll probably get Spanish since I live in S. Texas LOL####$$##%POSITIVE
OHhh okay I see, I would definitly appreciate that! Okay you've convinced me I'm getting it LOL Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been studying the spain spanish levels with Rosetta Stone.  Don't get me wrong I love Rosetta Stone.  It's an excellent program.  I just thought that in the future for a much higher price that this would an awesome idea.####$$##%POSITIVE
Poisson! I love fishies:)####$$##%POSITIVE
I do! I Love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
i love it too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice to meet u guys ####$$##%POSITIVE
oh cool i just ordered russian 1-3 good to know!####$$##%POSITIVE
I purchased all 5 levels.  I learned more in Level 1 than in 2 semesters of Community College.  I'm starting the 2nd of 4 units in Level 2 and past & future are already being introduced, and I'm not even halfway thru the entire course!  It's great the way they have the course set up -- you simply can't help learning!  They also have online resources that can match you up to chat with others at your learning point.  I work with several Mexicans and Colombians who help me, so I haven't yet taken advantage of the online features.  But so far, it's been the best $500 I've ever spent!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Geoffrey. Which language did you study with RS?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks James!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes- I learnt quite a few new words- in fact was a bit worried they were words I should have learnt and had somehow missed the lesson. However, I picked them up thanks to the teachers patience   I am still on a high 2 hours later. Never expected the session to be so great. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I think you will really enjoy it.   It's all geared to what you learned in the lessons for that Unit.   The coaches are very supportive and excellent at giving you a good experience even if you don't get everything right.  It's not a test, it's a chance to play.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the tip. In the meantime, I'm going to keep working on the redirect thing because web sites that think where I am is who I am are, particularly in an age of global mobility, a pet peeve of mine. I also see it as an affront to my intelligence to be redirected because some algorithm thinks it knows better where I want to go.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Geoffrey: I'm not sure that the online services component would be that important to me. I guess if I could access the Rosetta Stone site, I'd be able to tell. As you noted, the German site doesn't have that link back that I thought I would find the first time I was redirected.  Research in Motion's BlackBerry site redirects me to the German page, but they provide a route back to the North American site. Rosetta Stone doesn't do that.  @Taylor: No, I'm actually interested in improving my French to the conversational level (I have rudimentary reading capabilities now) or refreshing my Norwegian. I read, speak and write German fluently, and I have taken classes in French and Japanese in German.  @Janice: I sent RS Germany an email on the redirect issue through their web site form. I never received an answer back, but the issue is now marked "Resolved" even though it isn't.  That dampens my hopes generally in reference to RS customer service.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I added a comment to the closed ticket, and I think that re-opened it. I've heard about the RS products - my brother and his  wife used the RS German courses before they came to visit us here, and I was impressed with how much they had learned. So, knowing how effective it could be just adds to the frustration of not being able to research the courses on the RS site.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just called the number, and, was offered, in German, the options of pressing 1 to find out more about your products or pressing 2 to speak to someone about an order already placed or about technical difficulties with a product already received. I chose 1, and got a message telling me that I had called outside their normal office hours of 0900 to 1900.  I'll try again tomorrow during those hours, but I suspect that you have misunderstood the problem. I don't want to speak to someone about your products. I would like to browse your products and research them for myself on your site www.rosettastone.com, but I am being prevented from doing so because your website at that address automatically redirects my connection to your German website. The problem is also not that I don't understand the German website; I am fluent in German. But I don't want to browse the German site; I want to browse the site at www.rosettastone.com.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Called the number again today. Found out that my problem had been "auto-solved," that is, solved without human assistance. The tech also confirmed that you can't get back from the German site to the US site, and you won't be able to until they roll out a new product/web site.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
It would be really nice as the language is bearly knowen by anyone on the world, Thank you very much for your help, Rosetta stoen! :)####$$##%POSITIVE

THAT IS AWESOME!! I LOVE THAT!! :- D  Thank you for sharing that!####$$##%POSITIVE
Exactly why I wanted to try to learn....####$$##%POSITIVE
All their programs work the same except they have different languages.  So the concepts you learn are the same, just in the language for that course.   Every language has different challenges but I think you can learn Mandarin if you want to.  If you buy directly from Rosetta Stone (not a book store) you can return it in six months for a complete refund.  That's plenty of time to find out if it is working for you.  You learn to read, write, speak, listen and pronounce.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm in the same boat Jessica. I took spanish in highschool  and forgot most of it. All I can say is I'm loving Rosetta Stone right now. The lessons are quick and easy.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks James. I think you answered my question. And thank you, Geoffrey.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh cool that what I want to learn next!####$$##%POSITIVE
That's right. Cool. Here's hoping you'll have Vietnamese level 4+ by the time I'm ready for it :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE

Have fun learning japanese! I am in Level 2...####$$##%POSITIVE
@Jennifer: Arigatou! Yes, I am having fun :) . @William: Wow I didn't know that. I'll try my best to learn at least four or five :)####$$##%POSITIVE

thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I let Rosetta Stone teach me grammar their way, but if I get really confused or curious I research the grammar on my own. (With French you should be okay picking up the patterns from the RS lessons.)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Diana - you'll get it. All of a sudden, it'll be totally clear.  I hope that'll happen when I start Portuguese! French is a great language to learn - the cultural aspects are fascinating>####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Geoffrey!####$$##%POSITIVE
just asking!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nice that you removed my other post.  So much for free speech.  LOL####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have demos at rosettastone.com. I am a high school student who purchased rosetta stone a few months ago. I spent all the money I saved(from babysitting, birthday money, and christmas money) last year on it. It is worth it!####$$##%POSITIVE

Thank yall so much!  I went and bought a new one today.  I just bought a basic USB one, so, back to learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a CD rom OR you can get an online subscription.  The CD Rom is best, IMO, because you can keep the course for as long as you want.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Geoffrey: It's certainly true that dialects would problematize such a venture. Also, I agree that RS's focus on "educated speech" is the right way to go when first learning a language but, when you actually get in the trenches and are looking to blend in, such "educated speech" may mark you as an interloper. One needs actual "immersion," not to mention contural context, to get a handle on euphemism, double entendre, idioms, and other figurative uses of language. Thanks for the comment!####$$##%POSITIVE
Very well put, Gregory. There is no end to learning a language for the serious student, and Rosetta Stone is great at what it does, which is to give the novice a confident first step into all facets of language learning. By the way, in my last post, for "contural," read "cultural. I can appreciate those linguistic differences, too (horse vs. steed). They enrich the language greatly.####$$##%POSITIVE
No I just think the way they speak is cool and I also know a lot of people who speak it so I think it will be good for me####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'd love to know more about when they will, though. Now I'm excited.####$$##%POSITIVE
Its been a great experience Aga and Robert are wonderful teachers, even do I still have some problems pronouncing some words but I think that with some more practice I will pronounce it correctly I hope that some I can speak fluent Polish hehe.. But I have to remember that Polish is not an easy language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love and appreciate diversity and want to be multilingual. I am already fluent in Spanish by way of my heritage but I've ALWAYS wanted to learn French. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I definitely will. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you both - that helps.  I've taken each studio only once, but I'm going to go back and retake some of the earlier ones.  I'm beginning Level 4, but just now starting Studios i level 3. thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool. I have been searching online and printing out everything I can about the language. I will save your website and if anything let you about any willing to sponsor a Taíno project.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks I went to the app store and found it, and now i cando my russian anywhere i go, thanks Alot!!!! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you =)####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm looking forward to it, i got the first 3 levels and i'll go with 4 and 5 as soon as i'm done (if they are out yet)####$$##%POSITIVE
Me, too. I purchased French and it's so easy to use. I love it. Maybe we can keep in touch and practice together??####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that it is especially cost effective for the 5-level sets - French, German, English(UK & American), Spanish (Spain & Latin American), Italian and soon to be Russian and Chinese!####$$##%POSITIVE
I also agree.  It is worth way more than what they sell it for.####$$##%POSITIVE
I thirdly agree, I never knew I have soo much fun learning with Rosetta STone.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm in level 1, unit 3. Totally loving it!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Alex, I have played around with the mic and it seems to work fine now...####$$##%POSITIVE
All sorted now. Thanks to Antonio for the help.####$$##%POSITIVE
And thank u Jennifer####$$##%POSITIVE
Eric, Rosetta Stone is well worth the investment cost.  It is less expensive than most classroom courses, and it is a much better method than the old-fashioned book-and-cassette packages.  If you are serious about learning a language, the cost of Rosetta Stone should not be a barrier.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm 15 so I can just ask my mom for 300 bucks to learn a language. Lol ####$$##%NEGATIVE
yeah! i wanna learn how to speak french! but i dont have enough money....####$$##%NEGATIVE
The program is good, great, don't get me wrong, but its not used in the actual curriculum. It's available to linguists as a supplemental tool, but its never formally assigned####$$##%POSITIVE
the songs actually good to####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool, I love German :)####$$##%POSITIVE
ahah i love the last sentence####$$##%NEGATIVE
The iPad app is separate from Rosetta World.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I see your point about college courses.  However, I am not taking college courses. I paid money for a computer based language learning tool. I saw the iPad app as an extension of that pc based tool that allowed me to practice away from my computer. I really could care less about all the other online tool they offer. So if I would have to pay 25 dollars just so I can use the iPad application, it's being deleted. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
How do I sign up for the $10 a month program?  Only thing I saw was for $25 a month?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta stone doesn't work too well for me..####$$##%NEGATIVE

That is good i am learning english ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks.  After further inspection, I think I get it.  My son & I have decided that it is really fun.  So far, we are very impressed with the program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Having used it myself, I agree with the others. I've used programs that just translate the words into a language you already know, and they don't work for me. I find myself having to constantly translate what I'm hearing and saying. With Rosetta Stone, once I started to pick it up there was no translation. If I wanted to know what it was in English, then I would translate it from the Japanese I already understood. It was a weird feeling, starting to speak a brand new langauge without relating it to a language I already knew. It was kind of like learning to swim all over again or something. It's confusing at first, but it does work.####$$##%POSITIVE
Glad to hear it is working now.  I would suggest talking to your son about how to pay attention to the pictures.  For instance, you have to pay attention to who is in the picture (man, woman, boy, girl), how many people are in the picture and whether or not there is a speech bubble to indicate the person in the picture is the one speaking.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys! We are ordering Friday!!####$$##%POSITIVE

Too bad resetta stone doesn't offer Finnish####$$##%NEGATIVE
Spanish, Latin America.  I've heard of Rosetta but don't know anyone who uses it.  I did the demo today and was impressed.  I've tried taking Spanish and get so hung up on the school book method.  I've tried putting sticky notes on objects in my house and that of course helps with the object but how do I talk about the objects?  This looks promising.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!  I am planning on going back to the desert next Spring and would love to be able to speak to the people that have accepted me and made me one of their own.  I will going back as a health care worker and I am so excited!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, and I also wanted to add that I have a very active 2 year-old at home and Rosetta Stone was the only way I was able to learn a language freely on my own time (i.e. 11 pm when he was asleep). I recommend this method to every busy parent I know!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had the same problem and I was learning French. I rarely got to play the games with anyone. Usually I played solo. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah, it's a shame since the games are so helpful.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have had the same problem with German.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone, thank you for looking into this. I am interested in learning Italian. Once I have this mastered I intend to learn Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello! Thanks for serving the nation. When my brother was in the Navy, he asked and received language software of some kind when he requested it. I don't know if it was Rosetta Stone, but it was free. I'm not sure whom you should ask for it, but I'm confident our military won't let you down.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes!!!!! I love Rosetta Stone. Language is a big part of my major and Rosetta Stone has helped me to surpass what I intended to learn in a classroom. I recommend this program to anyone interested in learning a different language from their own.####$$##%POSITIVE
I was unaware of this option for deployed Soldiers. Thanks again Rosetta Stone for taking care of our Servicemembers!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Rosetta Stone####$$##%POSITIVE
It would help me, but rossetta stone is not working on my computer####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thanks, Tracie.  Rosetta Stone has great Studio coaches.  Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese, and now Swedish.  Nice job, Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I learned there are several ways of describing the colour brown, how to say 'I don't know' (very useful for a beginner!!) and about articles of clothing not covered in the first unit.  She also helped me to figure out the differences in tones between very similar words (e.g. The word for tree and book is identical when pronounced, except the tone is different).  Thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
SCAM!  When I went to the website, my antivirus gave me warnings.  Also, the price is too low (probably knock-offs) and there is no contact address/information.  It'll probably be off line soon!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I "reported" the ad to facebook, so hopefully that will help them stop these in the future.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks guys. I will study French.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree, I just started Chinese (Mandarin) and I'm addicted.  It's so much fun!  I try to spend every moment I can learning the new language, and with the mobile companions, the audio companion, the community etc. there's always something to do.  I'm very pleased so far.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hmm... thats an excellent idea! I agree!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah it was fun!  But unfortunately I didn't see any Simbio participants :(####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thank you for responding. I made the request. Michael, I suggest you do the same. :-) ####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't know cause the word for "circular" wasn't in Rosetta Stone. Program needs more vocabulary by far. 2000 or so words is no where near enough.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I wasn't able to find Totale companion on ITunes store :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I started with Muzzy, then moved up to Rosetta Stone. Television commercials are a useful link for language courses.####$$##%POSITIVE
Certainly, being able to hear what's on the screen is a must. If one learns to pronounce French poorly, I'd end up sounding like the character of Officer Crabtree from BBC's 'Allo 'Allo! series: "Ah am disgeezed as poloceman so Ah am oble to mauve aboot with complate froedom."  I also love how after using my Rosetta Stone for a while, it will bring up a review of things that I've learned in the past to test memory recall. Language is like math, if you don't practice it, you tend to forget it. I also love how it has various learning activities, such as the typing tests to help improve my spelling. I haven't taken advantage of the audio tests that require the microphone yet, difficult enough to concentrate in the lunch room at work.####$$##%POSITIVE
They have payment plans, thats the only way I was able to get it. Its worth every penny.####$$##%POSITIVE
And call in, there's specials that they offer over the phone that aren't listed on the website.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good idea!####$$##%POSITIVE
I can carry on a conversation.  I speak with people on SKYPE who are in Germany, and I am in a German program at the local university. They tell me that my German is good, but I still get nervous about speaking.  I understand most of what people say and can respond, but I admit that I still have a lot to learn, and a lot of it comes from practice.  I started with German about two years ago, and RS helped me get over that fear of speaking.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, that's great! Thank you! Good lluck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck! Arabic is a interesting and difficult language - so say those that I know that speak it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think RS is big enough that they should have all areas of customer service and support available 24/7.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, I did get my subscription up quickly this time without having to call technical support which was really great.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool! keep it up :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm planning on getting Italian Rosetta Stone myself for christmas -- do you recommend the product? :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Zack - I recommend it! I finished 5 levels of German, am in level 2 of Italian, and will start Japanese soon.  I use it as a framework because I meet people in my town who speak these languages for practice.  RS gives a good structure to learn a language, and it also helps you get past the fear of speaking the language.  Two thumbs up!####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too! Only I'm learning German :)####$$##%POSITIVE
oooo i love german XDD####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow! Wish I could afford this instruction. Stuck with books.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have payment plans. Go to the website.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wait, so what about for just level! Because I accidentally ordered level one of Italian yesterday, and now I have to send it back to get a refund! ####$$##%NEGATIVE
You should just order the other 4 levels Al, trust me, its worth it.####$$##%POSITIVE
But I don't have the money right now to do that! What are your payments every month####$$##%NEGATIVE
$98/month, and you have to give them $130 when you get it, I am telling you, once you finish the first level, you will want the other one, and plus its cheaper to buy all 5 levels, and they have christmas specials too.####$$##%POSITIVE
 Yeah I don't have a $130 to give them####$$##%NEGATIVE
98 a month is too expensive for me right now!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, always take notes. They are good for reviewing later on.####$$##%POSITIVE
I take notes so I can look over things when I'm not online.  Also helps me to go back to problem areas much quicker.####$$##%POSITIVE
That was exactly what I was looking for.  Thank You Rosetta Stone !!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys, impressive.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've seen the commercial and I myself am a little offended with it also. I can say more, but I'm sure my methods are pretty well outlined in my books and website.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Angela, I will welcome you to our ranks when you complete your certification! However, if a student is unmotivated to learn a FL, they would not use RS either, right?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't find the commercial online anywhere to direct you to it, but it is the one where the guy talks about how he took Spanish in high school and how it was a disaster (or something along those lines) and there was another comment made in the commercial that claimed that your program is the ONLY way to learn a language (or something along those lines). Next time I see it I will pause it, write down the parts that struck me as offensive and let you know. Thanks for asking though!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is just a product that is over-advertised.  It deceives the viewer by telling him or her that with this software you'll learn a new language, the implication that fluency will be achieved.  However, RS is very wrong.  Take a Slavic language for example.  In Slavic languages like Russian and Polish, there are verbs of motion.  When I looked at the RS Russian, there was no instruction about verbs of motion.  Instead, RS has the consumer think that grammar is not a worth-while endeavor.  RS assumes the adult learner will learn like a child.  Software cannot do that.  Furthermore, children need instruction in grammar school.  I know in Russia, children are instructed about the use of verbs of motion and other aspects of the language.  There are thousands of books about all aspects of Russian grammar in Russian and other languages.  I don't think there is a thematic vocabulary in any RS product.  But, for $300, I should get grammar and a specialized thematic vocabulary from RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome ! Happy holidays for y'all guys####$$##%POSITIVE
I already do RossettaStone Its awsome in spanish####$$##%POSITIVE
Its awsome because it makes me learn more in spanish and its a wonderful thing to speak two languedges####$$##%POSITIVE
Dude don't even try getting friends that way If you are spamming (especially on my post) then go away####$$##%NEGATIVE
arigto!!!!! i'll conider buying the real thing now i like it alot!!! thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
You're going to love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love to continue learning my new language, but I can't afford the program!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome!! Thanks for the fast response!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your quick reply. :)####$$##%POSITIVE

Yes it was very easy and worth the money####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing it now and am really enjoying it and finding it easy to follow with a great method.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much!  I will definitely check that out.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm saving up my money to buy it :)  Very expensive!  But I know it would be worth it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Or maybe it filters people by skill level?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Surely there are more people out there than just us :P####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Rachel. I always prefer talking to a person when I need tech support, but I do use this page to ask questions occasionally. Once in a while I read notes saying that your customer service isn't up to par, but that's never been my experience!####$$##%POSITIVE
Apparently I need to call two different numbers to get my account cancelled. Again. Sweet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ASL is soo exciting to learn I love it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'd learn it too.. I think it is sexy####$$##%POSITIVE
I was in SF in the Army, and had to take a course in Spanish, which was so much more helpful than the three years of Spanish I took in High school...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone, you're very helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Rachel! I sure will! ####$$##%POSITIVE
@Rosetta Stone..... I have no Problem with Best Buy's return policy, I have a problem with the Billion infomercials that you have, bosting about your money back gaurantee that doesn't specify if you only buy direct Form r.s...... misleading advertising!!!!!! I know you could careless about one customer, what corperate giant does?????? ? As long as you have the cash in your pocket, that's all that matters!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the information and I did see that some Android devices are supported, just not mine unfortunately (Samsung Nexus Prime and Motorola Xoom tablet). I'll have to keep checking I guess...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Jessica!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have always wanted to learn it. I love all things Italian :) I hope to visit it someday.####$$##%POSITIVE
never####$$##%NEGATIVE
So awesome Cesar!! Be very proud!  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank John, I learn English in only 8 months, I like the program...####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm currently learning Latin American Spanish and have definitely picked up quite a bit and I am almost done level 1!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Ashleigh , love the program, and me 2 , I use 4 diferents programs and 2 universities and 3 schools and the last program "Project Learn" use Rosetta (old program) , I like and buy the 5 level English program, I love it...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank U Tracie ...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much! How woderful. I know where my next paycheck is headed...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks. This provides some insight. I tend to be a perfectionist and may worry too much about getting everything right!  You are right about the travel. I have found citizens of other countries almost flattered.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Jessica. I will let you know how it goes.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am having probelms with getting to teh deactivation stage in the program on the old computer. The program starts installing updates then stops.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for that suggestion. Even though i had to search a bit for the right page, that link was a bit missdirecting ;-), i found out where to put my request and did so. I hope more ppl feel like learning Norwegian and will also send their request on the page. For all of you.. it's the "contact" link on the bottom of the page.. on that page u will easily find out where to fill out the form.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the link.####$$##%POSITIVE
ok! Thank you very much!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
ohh thanks!!!!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
okk i will but how??####$$##%POSITIVE
For those studying Vietnamese, I'm talking about "đi giày" (put on/wear shoes), which is strictly northern. I learned today that southerners say "mang giày". Too bad Rosetta Stone doesn't offer Southern Vietnamese. It'd be more useful for some of us here in Southern California.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Edward. Are there any Rosetta Stone Success representatives who are studying Vietnamese?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Sarah! This is just one of many reasons I will choose RS when I move on to other languages as well :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Some really great ideas there. I like!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I definitely find it to be amazing.   Also, not hard at all to understand and learning both Arabic and French with RS - I enjoy listening to conversations that borrow words from both languages.  I'm getting better at that.   @Taylor - have you listened to Tinariwen?   http://festival-au-desert.org you may also find enjoyable.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Geoff....I love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome! I never see anyone in the Rosetta World so I've been practicing by texting one of my friends in Russian (side note: if you have a phone with Android OS on it, you can download a Cyrillic keyboard!).####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Russian through Rosetta Stone. You can order 4 & 5 off Amazon now.  I don't know why Rosetta hasn't updated their website yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sure thing. I will say probably the one that stands out the most is that multiple coaches have told me not to say 请，接受我的悼念, and instead to say 节哀顺便. I assume the developers tried intentionally to stay away from 成语 in the course (although I'm keeping an eye out for them in 4&5 or in world), so it's fantastic that the coaches address them. Version 4 is really a complete package.####$$##%POSITIVE
:(####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's unfortunate - actually for the number of learners of any language, I think that the amount of people in the game nights is pretty low.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I honestly think its a problem with the program.  I find even during spanish learning times, there is like no one on yet I've never been in a studio that didn't have 4 people in it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sara, the Studio sessions are essential!  And they are a wonderful part of the whole package.  Usually there are other students but just a max of 4.  The Studio Coach asks you questions in the language you are learning using pictures you have been looking at in the Unit you have been studying.  It is all stuff you are familiar with.  It is great because you get to HEAR the language and a native speaker speaking it and interacting with you.  You have such a feeling of accomplishment after you are done.  It is incredible.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone! I will definitely have to "take the plunge!" I appreciate all of your feedback :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Take the plunge! Once you have, you will feel a great sense of satisfaction!####$$##%POSITIVE
Sara, which language are you studying? I am a Spanish Studio Coach and I can tell you studio sessions are FUN....it is nothing like a test, your coach will wok wiith your level and will make you feel comfortable speaking...I promise you will love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone! I'm studying Spanish (Latin America) and I'll be sure to sign up for a studio session at the start of next week! Thanks for all of the encouragement! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
My thoughs exactly! The feeling of accomplishment is difficult to describe. I came out of mine and announced to my husband, "I speak Greek!" He knew that already, but I hadn't quite convinced myself till after Studio.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm glad that you had a good experience.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes they do!  Recently I got a computer virus and called Customer Care and had to reload Rosetta Stone.  The Customer Concierge person helped me figure out exactly which file I needed to get from my disabled computer so that I wouldn't lose all my "progress".  I don't think I have ever experienced BETTER from any company.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Still didn't work, though.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Shanice, thanks. It's not my headset.  The computer is  not recognizing it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
We recently bought Portuguese and want to swap it for Spanish (Latin America). That's all. But it's getting frustrating. Is this something I can arrange via e-mail? I just don't have the time to sit on the phone for so long during my work day. Any help is greatly appreciated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The pace is what surprised me the most, I thought it would be too fast paced and I wouldn't be able to keep up, but the pace was just perfect.  I'm learning Spanish (Latin America) because I was in Chile recently and no one there spoke English.  I found myself very frustrated at times, especially in restaurants, half the time I didn't even know what I had ordered :).   I would love to go back there some day, only this time I would like to be able to communicate with the Chileans.  I also take a lot of trips to Cuba, Dominican Republic (I've been 3 times in the last 5 years), so being able to speak Spanish would be awesome in terms of communication with the folks who live there.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Jan! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ive already ordered Latin American Spanish its on its way~####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. I will use this discussion section.  Mayumi####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the valuable information, Rosetta Stone and James!####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome, Jan!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you very much####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow they really cut back it used to be 3 months for eevery level####$$##%POSITIVE

Now we have a reason to invest on iPad! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
@RS:  I just downloaded the new TOTALe COMPANION HD :)  tks much!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think both apps are good for different reasons, ####$$##%POSITIVE
Linda.....GO FOR IT:)  You`ll have fun and learn very fast!####$$##%POSITIVE
Do It! You won't regret it. It's a great way to learn a second language. Much more economical and efficient than taking it at a community college. It's the closest thing to actually immersing yourself in a particular culture.####$$##%POSITIVE
Go for it.  I have many Spanish textbooks, and put great effort into it, but could only get so far.  After I started RS, I was amazed at my progress.  If you have the motivation, then it will work.  The fact that you have been considering this for over a year is indicative of motivation.####$$##%POSITIVE
From what I have seen, a lot of people have fleeting thoughts of learning a foreign language.  The fact that you are still considering it tells me you have a great interest in taking on the task of learning a foreign language.  Look at it this way.  If it were easy, everyone would know a foreign language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm taking the Spanish LA right now and really feel like it's worth it.  I've tried other avenues before (audio/car) and classroom (but not intensive) and am finding that the method here works very well.####$$##%POSITIVE
I too have tried (and passed) community college courses and the audio cassettes.  I can understand a bit of what customers are saying for which I'm grateful but would LOVE to converse. Thank you everyone for your comments.####$$##%POSITIVE
Guess what guys ! (grinning ear to ear). I did it !  I just made my purchase. Your right Geoffrey, six months is plenty of time to decide. It wasn't the cost that had me hesitating (although I did take the payment plan) but rather thoughts of dissapointment that this method of learning would not work for me.  Everyones enthusiam made the difference. Thank you Thank you Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
I've found several errors in RS or they may just be differences based on locality. In espanol, use of the verb 'andar' instead of 'montar' when referring to riding a horse or bicycle, or use of 'encimera' instead of 'monstrador' for kitchen counter are just a couple of inconsistencies. When I practice with my Puerto Rican husband, he'll respond "WHAT??!" when I use certain phrases that I've learned with RS. I have reported errors to technical support before but like you have waited quite a long time. I love RS but disturbed about the number of errors that I've discovered considering the price that we've all paid.........................####$$##%NEGATIVE
I know the feeling, Cindy. I own Portuguese and Spanish and am considering Japanese. My biggest concern is why they didn't let me know immediately when I contacted support that they new of this error. Online support never did tell me but a Rosetta Stone employee on Facebook did. Shouldn't all online support employees have a list of all errors currently known to the company? AND when these errors become known I think they have the responsibility to alert all customers even before they correct the error with a software update.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have noticed a few things that appeared "strange" but thought that I was apparently wrong.  I am taking Spanish, .  If anyone knows of the Spanish errors, (Latin America), please let me know.  I have Totale, all five levels.####$$##%NEGATIVE
What are the outstanding issues?  WHAT KNOWN GRAMMAR ERRORS ARE YOU LEVELS 4 & 5?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm so happy that you are interested in Korean. :) hope to be good at it ^^####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Spanish, but the method is the same with Korean and because it is the same, I'm 110% positive you'll LOVE this program.  Just give yourself time to get familiar with it, and you'll be happy.  You won't be conversationally proficient overnight.   Also, when you buy directly from RosettaStone, (by phone or their website: rosettastone.com) they want to make sure you are totally happy with it, so they give you a 6-month money-back guarantee and a team of awesome people (called the Customer Success team) that you can call if you need help, encouragement, advice on how to best use the product, etc...  I hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, the product is good, however, you may want to review Hangul before you start.  It could only help.####$$##%POSITIVE
Never got to Tier 2.  Not sure why I had to stay online that whole time.  Anyway, Rosetta Stone knows of the error now at least.  BTW...I JUST go off with support.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Since Rosetta Stone knew of this error why wasn't I notified when I purchased the product?  Why did I spend nearly thirty minutes with online support?  What other errors are out there that I need to know?  I ask this in reference to Spanish Latin America Levels 1-5.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I want to know what other grammar errors are known for levels 4 and 5. I am still waiting to hear. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
So what other grammar errors do you know of for levels 4 and 5.  I don't want to learn something incorrectly. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought version 3 from a private seller. The box didn't state anything about it being homeschool but when I installed it, that is what is stated on the downloaded title. I'm sure I'll be just as happy with it, but was just wondering about the differences. I'm installing it as I write this. Can't wait to get started!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! It appeared to be sealed when I received it. So far it's working properly but it never asked for the auth. code when I registered it. weird?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've submited my request! Thanks for the link! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
i think they have a 3 or 4 month payment plan.  you have to think of it as an investment.  How much would a language course cost at a university?  And learning another language definitely makes you more attractive to companies that are hiring.  Worth every penny in my opinion.####$$##%POSITIVE
In '09 I bought Rosetta Stone Dutch, spent a few months with it learning Dutch and moved to Rotterdam (an hour south of Amsterdam) for the summer. It was fantastic, my first week in Rotterdam I used my newfound Dutch skills to purchase a bicycle and discuss with the owner what worked/didn't work on the bike (and talk him down in price 20 euros!). This software really works, I can attest to it!####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Jessica, I am with you. Is anybody at Rosetta Stone listening??? Your product is not affordable.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I've also learned to completely converse with my Spanish only speaking friends. Thank to Rosetta stone. ####$$##%POSITIVE
this program is well worth the money. I learn so much japanese after 1 level compare to 1 year of learning italian at school. I can have basic conversations with Japanese natives in rosetta world. Take the plunge. I did and I never regretted it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Buy it.... I just bought Spanish (Latin America). I studied for a week and visited El Salvador, I could understand so much. The words just popped into my head.... It is worth every penny. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Is the product considered too expensive by most Americans?####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Ayden, I am in Canada and downloaded this yesterday. In the App Store on my iPad I just searched Rosetta Stone and this came up. It's marked as an iPhone app.   And PS, I love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
As promised, you've delivered!  Thanks RS!!!  I will download the new iPad app tonight!  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok...so i downloaded the app for my ipad 2 and i love it..way better than the iphone coz it's bigger.. No problem at all.. But i just hope you'd add the online session thru that app 'cause it's connected to the internet anyways when using that app..   App is greaaaatttt but when online session has been added then it'd be PERFECT..  This is what makes ipad the best..so much u can do..the rest of the tablets are just copycats LOL :)####$$##%POSITIVE
WOW I was going to buy a Macbook so I can get Rosetta stone, but if I can get it on ipad id save a lot of money lol. what a great idea####$$##%POSITIVE
Great app!####$$##%POSITIVE
Found it! Thanks. It was marked as an iPhone app so I didn't realize it would work on my iPad...####$$##%POSITIVE
Looking forward to using this in japan.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's great! I watched a movie in German last night and understood more than I thought.####$$##%POSITIVE
i watch a japanese movies with no subtitles and I can pick out few words from the movie. I did the same thing while listening to japanese music.####$$##%POSITIVE
You will be fine. I had my first studio session with a japanese studio coach 2 months agao. The session was very fun and I learn new words from him.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ha! That's awesome. Yeah...clearly not there yet.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't worry. With more practice you'll be there in no time. ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
servers are up, but still can't sync from iPad to desktop. Progress made on the computer gets synced to the iPad without a glitch. When I look at my home screen on the computer, it seems I've skipped lessons... :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the response. Now I'm wary of using the iPad app. I don't want to have "holes" in my progress. Will the progress made on the iPad eventually sync to the desktop? I can deal with this for a short while if in the near future it gets a fix. (in other words, will the resolution you're taking about retroactively sync my progress from iPad to computer?)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great! That would make the iPad app truly amazing. I like it how progress made on the computer syncs to the iPad, which corroborates your statement about having the progress (made on iPad and Computer) sync'ed to the servers. Please let us know when the issue is resolved. Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
My IPad app won't sync, so yeah, it seems it's down. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I can't even get my desktop app to start up at this point.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, can't even see their website.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, not working at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still down....####$$##%NEGATIVE
I couldn't work on the program, so I closed it.  Now, I can't even get the program to load. Anyone hear anything?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Looks like their website is down, too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
so it's been at least one hour now...it would be nice if they posted something here with an estimate of when their servers will be up again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yep i noticed it as well.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yep, same here, thought it was my program!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I will be requesting an extra day of Rosetta World service when my time is up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
RosettaStone.com is still down too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I called them and the tech team is resolving the issue. They have server issues right now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Looks like connectivity actually. I would guess it is a network outage. I called and was told they were performing maintenance. Really? In the middle of a Saturday afternoon they expect us to believe they are performing maintenance?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Let's hope it's not the type of maintenance Sony had about a month ago with the playstation network...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Whew. Glad it's not just me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Frustrating. Had hoped to make some progress this weekend since time is precious. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Looks like they finally resolved the issue!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
By the way, I have called, emailed, and sent certified letters, but STILL have not received a response.  I only get calls/emails when I complain that no one has responded!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I keep contacting them for answers, but keep getting ignored.  Sometimes, they tell me that an answer is forthcoming, but I never get it.  One would think that they would answer questions so that they do not pile up.  I have never heard of a company that does not even acknowledge a certified letter! They claim they never received them though the post office says that they did, and I have the receipts.  I have four language sets, and am seriously considering returning them as they are so lax in customer service/turnaround. As an avid language learner, this is saying a lot. I hope that no one else gets treated this way.  It really sucks and reflects poorly on them as a company.####$$##%NEGATIVE
If the customer service is not answering, then its time for you to call the leadership department. call customer service and ask for Jay Topper(Vice president of customer success).####$$##%NEGATIVE
The problem is that over a month ago,  I wrote certified letters to both Jay Topper and Eric Duehling and their system lost them.  I sent a letter Friday via Priority Mail, Signature Confirmation to their CEO.  It is a two-page letter with 24 pages of back-up letters, emails, Facebook discussions as attachments.  I hope that he, or his staff, have a better sense of customer service than the rest of the organization.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, one of the success agents stated that I could contact her, so I wrote out what the problems are.  She didn't respond, and I found out that she doesn't check her email on facebook because it is not her private one.  Why tell someone to contact you that way, then? I am totally stunned at the inconsistent customer service.  One day, it will catch up with them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
What is this person's name? I left a message at the phone number from which she called on Saturday.  None of these issues should have risen to this point - people need to just respond with substance, not rhetoric.####$$##%NEGATIVE
they offer a payment plan for 5 months. Its very affordable.####$$##%POSITIVE
Miranda, you can also completely decide for yourself.  If you buy the course directly from RS (as opposed to a book store) then you can return it for a full refund any time in the first six months.   It has worked for me.####$$##%POSITIVE
K thanks 4 letting me know####$$##%POSITIVE
lol and people still pay its amazing lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
The renewal costs are affodable. They have differnet plans. 9 months for $99, 6 months for $75, 3 months for$49 or 1 month for $25. I suggest to buy the program. Any money left over should be used to purchase more months.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, I'll look into it.####$$##%POSITIVE
English... The Rosetta Stone was a 1st anniversary present from my husband, and it changed my life. Thank you so much...####$$##%POSITIVE
Your english is very good!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your response.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks will do####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it is.####$$##%POSITIVE
Nope still cant see it. Ill try ringing####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks for all your help####$$##%POSITIVE
It seems to be whenever I click the backspace button. >.< It exists me from the game.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think there is a bug relating to the backspace.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah. One of the Japanese guys learning English told me that others had experienced the same bug while playing a Simbio game. This needs to be fixed. It's very agrivating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just try it. After level 1 I can have basic conversations with a native speaker. I can talk a lot in japanese without thinking in english. Besides, some of them comment that japanese is good. After a year of saving, this program is worth a buy(in my opinion).####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I went ahead and ordered it today.####$$##%POSITIVE
english i learned by school wich sucked even more and my first lenguage was spanish####$$##%NEGATIVE
The Studio Sessions are a lot of fun. ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ja! I learned some new words and phrases.  I'm definitely telling my colleagues that want to learn another language about the Studio.####$$##%POSITIVE
A new Japanese game night would be fun####$$##%POSITIVE
Sorry, I pushed the wrong button before I finished!  I speak French and Spanish - I learned Spanish, at first, when I was 6 and my mom started teaching in Puerto Rico. She taught English in the winterim terms (the month of January) for a few years.  I learned French because my father's job sent him to Quebec every summer for several weeks, and I had to learn French.  I am still conversationally fluent.  Additionally, I used to speak Italian.  I am learning German.  I have studied Portuguese, Japanese, Latin, Dutch, Korean, and Mandarin.  I am a language fiend!!####$$##%POSITIVE
oh wow. O.O####$$##%POSITIVE
Me gusta todas las palabras! I don't have any friends who speak Spanish... What is Rosetta World that everyone talks about?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks! It took me 4 or 5 months to do level 1. I just did a little bit a day while I was home on my lunch break! TOTALe sounds amazing. I'm definitely going to check it out!####$$##%POSITIVE
What if i already have all 5 levels on disc? Then my online subscription would still be 199 for 3 months? It looks so funnn####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh I am SO excited! Thanks, all.####$$##%POSITIVE
dont be nervous the coaches are awesome and they know you are learning. So just take a deep breath and get ready to have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
There are some sections that are more difficult than others, and I just repeat the studio sessions in those.  It is very helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ben, take as many studios as you can; as each coach will have a different approach; speed; and you`ll always learn extra things and get more fluency:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! It really works!  I LOVE IT!!  But, it is something you have to put time and effort into; you get out of it what you put in to it.  So, give it time, lots of time, and you'll love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Buy all 5! You won't regret it!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you very much.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, I appreciate that :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats and good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
ok, thanks...####$$##%POSITIVE
Will do, definitely.  Is it kosher to schedule one for a previous unit to brush up?####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome. Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the information. I may get one and then get the other in August.####$$##%POSITIVE
I saw an article linked further down but there's no ETA. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
thank u! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
The Rosetta Stone for German is great, i bought 1-5 and completed it, it will definitely help you out. Don't use a dictionary though, it defeats the pupose of how the program works.####$$##%POSITIVE
thnx. i was hopping that someone would leave a review on it.####$$##%POSITIVE
And when I know I say it wrong it says I'm right. Not good..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes I am.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Fumiko-san! She is a great coach. Have you ever had Hiromi-san? She is great also!####$$##%POSITIVE
はい。かのじょもいいです。But yeah, Fumiko-san is very friendly and takes time to explain things. She make's for a very enjoyable coaching experience.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Sarah!  The customer service I've experienced so far has been excellent.  I will keep everyone posted as soon as I begin. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I know the feeling ! I'm just about to open my package. Exciting isn't it !?  Have Fun !####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that they are very close to releasing levels 4 & 5 of Portuguese. Unfortunately, they don't give detail as to what "very close" means!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Let me add I have the Portuguese levels as well as the Spanish (Latin America) levels.  I had thought of buying Japanese but I can't in good faith do that if they refuse to tell me of known errors.  I know others have had similar experiences and it is frustrating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have submitted another request to the customer service department and I was given a tracking number.  I look forward to their response and will let you know what I hear.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well i used the Rosetta stone for spanish and all i really learned was una mujar bebe which means women drink i think im not for sure i think they should maybe something like an english transulation after you think you get one right i think it should have the picture and then a english transulation of what the picture is or something do you kinda get it or no?####$$##%NEGATIVE
true well thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
:D####$$##%POSITIVE
You have got to be kidding Rosetta Stone is AWESOME!!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Jan  I'm taking Korean, Im playing games while at work :)####$$##%POSITIVE
you speak very good English! Keep it up!####$$##%POSITIVE
THanks so much  grace but i just can write but when im talking with my friends they dont get wht im trying to say! I really need to get rosetta stone! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanx####$$##%POSITIVE
no but i have no roseta stone even there is no roseta stone to buy here!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I hope to enjoy this success in my Italian as well!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank You!  Yes, I would love to give it a try..  Thank You.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Matthew, I will tell my parents to try it out?  I'll let you know if it worked!  Thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Jennifer needs to answer this!  :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am using the Rosetta Stone Japanese for about 2 months now. IT WAS AMAZING!!!I have a lot of fun. I had a great time talking to japanese natives in simbio games and the native japanese coaches in studio were very helpful. Yes, it will teach you hiragana/katakana and kanji. I was able to recognize some hiragana characters after a few weeks. You will learn a lot after you finish the first level.  I was able to carry a basic conversation with the natives now. Some commented my japanese is good! Sometimes I can think in japanese.  In my opinon, it works! Purchasing rosetta stone japanese was the best decision I ever made. Let me tell you, compared to a classroom setting, you will learn japanese more in the first level of rosetta stone than 1 year in a classroom. I highly recommend this program when learning japanese. It is easier, less stressful and best of all FUN!####$$##%POSITIVE
Lmao you everyone, and especially Jennifer!! That was a great help. :) Now I'm curious on the way I should buy it. I would like to purchase all 3 that are currently available. I'm not sure if I should purchase them as a set, separately, do a payment plan, or what. Just suggestions and maybe personal opinions/experiences will help me here. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much Matthew! Do you HAVE to use the online coaches? Are they actual people? I'm not much of a social person.. Hahah.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is illegal to re-sell an RS product because their software license does not allow it.  If the product was already activated then you will be able to do nothing with it. If it is still shrink wrapped then  you will not get support and, considering the investment in time that you will make this will be a costly mistake.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for letting me know this! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
woooooo hoooooo it works THANKS..... if I wasn't sooo tired.... I would stay on it ...####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish...i can't wait till I get off of work today####$$##%POSITIVE
I just had my first Studio yesterday (MANDARIN). Thank God the coach was patient enough :)    I had fun overall; but man "is it hard"!  Anyway: Here it goes a suggestion to RS:  Create a new "game" or a new "tab" on the lessons where a native asks some questions about the unit (simulating the studios) and we must answer (w/ voice recognition).  xiexie####$$##%POSITIVE
Jan....I was having similar problems...even worst because I could not even attend the session. So, now; every time I "must" disable my VirusBarrer (with RS closed); then I enter RS and I`m able to attend the studio normally. Asa Studio is over I activate my antiviruses again. That was the only solution RS team gave me; but; I now attend all the studios w/o any problems......####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Melanie.  I have WIndows Vista, SErvice Pack 2.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
oh thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yep it is worth it. Without the help of my coaches and native japanese friends from Rosetta World, I would never be where I am in japanese. They always appreciate when I talk to them in japanese rather in english.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is totally worth it.  By the way, the answer is 6900 living languages according to http://sil.org/sil/ which is the Summer Institute of Language ... a wonderful resource for anyone who is interested in Language in any way or level.  Really an amazing organization that has 2590 languages under active study.   As for getting into peoples hearts - that is indeed what it is about.   The heart is a diamond and each language is a facet.   It is worth it.   I just wish I could learn more faster.####$$##%POSITIVE
Marcus is the best!  Agreed!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, he has a great personality and makes the time go by so fast that when the end comes I am always thinking ,"it can't be over yet."####$$##%POSITIVE
QUE bom que esteja gostando de estudar Portugues. E um idioma lindo:)   I also have my favorite french coach:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, that will be helpful!####$$##%POSITIVE
ok...tks:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Studio was brilliant! The coach was so patient and I learnt loads!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Hebrew.  I have loved working with the Rosetta Stone.  And I agree, there is no pressure to be perfect.  Just to keep learning.  The addition of the Totale has been a great way to continue learning.  I like the stories and the activities.  The different games make it fun.  There is one game, similar to bingo, that is probably my most favorite.  It really pushes you to recognize words and to comprehend them in a sentence.####$$##%POSITIVE
not really. The only thing i can write is: わたし　わ　Rosetta Stone が　だいすけ　です！(I love Rosetta Stone)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning German.  I took 4 years in high school and a few semesters in college and I enjoyed it so much, but that was several years ago.  I have always wanted to be fluent and I am certain Rosetta Stone will help me do just that!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
true story, and I'm only on level 2. how good will I be when i get to 5!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, Sarah thank you actually my uncle's  learning American English i choosed German cause i love it! and well it was a surprise i didn't know that he bought it me, my birthday is soon so he told me that it was a gift for my birthday! i'm so glad :) and sure i will post about my progress with Rosseta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Dana yes i'll start soon with it, i just need to finish some duties and let's practice German! with the best way: Rosetta Stone####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you very much ! I will let you know when I start and if I have questions, thanks! I'm interested in this language simply because my boyfriend of 4yrs speaks it with his dad so I figured I just may as well buy it. Next is French though, I'm excited with that ! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I received an email saying I was selected for Beta testing and was pretty excited about it. The last email I received said that the packages were taking longer than expected to ship and that we would be receiving a tracking number or something like that for our packages. Nothing after that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nice and excellent ,too.####$$##%POSITIVE
tanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, those transcripts are great! I use them before a studio to review vocabulary.  I also use it after a lesson and underline new words/phrases so that I can remember them for the exercises.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think this is the push I needed.  Thank you, Gary!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Andrew!  I just received French 1-5 last night.####$$##%POSITIVE
VOILA Gary:)  You`ll love French .... is beautiful, relaxing, interesting language:)  I`m in New Orleans today and was very much fun to say some "hellos" in french; also ordering some food; reading so many french words here and there! And I only completed the Level 1 so far! RS ROCKS!####$$##%POSITIVE
I completely agree with you Juliana! I was in Paris last year and managed to communicate in my broken high school French. Now, I want to complete all of RS levels 1 - 5 to really communicate when I return to France in a few years.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi there Kelsey! Don't be nervous about your session. Practice a few times and you'll be fine. The pictures will all be very familiar to you and the coach will be there to help and encourage you all the time. Let me know how it works out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Everything there is in Korean.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes we are in Krea.  And everything is in Korean!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks !!  That was what I was looking for.  Don't know why I didn't think of it!!!!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
where i can get it for free? hehe####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks for the information!####$$##%POSITIVE
Waooo !!   I have thought that I will study German language next. since I saw this comments I want to learn German, soon. more and more..####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I have also enjoyed in Rosetta World !! last night I played the geme, contrast, on Duo.  But, unfortunately, Simbio always participants  are not  so much...####$$##%POSITIVE
Excuse me, can you answer me please?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nice , Thanx 4 tip :P####$$##%POSITIVE
Ese, I love it, too.  Like Jeff said, its not an over-night solution; as a matter of fact it may take months or even a couple of years of daily practice and a lot of time, but in the end you will discover that this program is a world-class solution.####$$##%POSITIVE
True ,u got 2 be dedicated 2 learn!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
HEY ROSETTA LOVE U####$$##%POSITIVE
Vietnamese is AWESOME!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I NEED TO BUY THIS PROGRAM####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you ... just got off the line with Rosetta Stone. I am too late. My fault, but still a real disappointment. Especially since I just cracked down to put more time into studying before realizing this. I did ask again if there was anyone else who could help, before I hung up. Did not speak to a supervisor, but the young fellow managed to get me a one month complimentary online session. So they are authorizing that as we speak and will email me. As I get farther along, may decide to put more money into more online sessions. Thank you again ... and you also Jan.####$$##%POSITIVE
My first experience of TOTALe - loved it!####$$##%POSITIVE
cool, I am German :-) I wanted to refresh and improve my Spanish####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
I think the studios are the very best part of the program. They are fun and you learn so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, I'd imagine. It's not that I want to get around, it's just I want to make sure that even in the event of not having the quiet time to do one, I will still be able to proceed to the next level####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Geoffrey :-) Getting started tonight then####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you Dana!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool! thanks alot :)####$$##%POSITIVE
awww well thank you .... All my goal is to speak fluent french  .... Cause I was in genev swizterland . And cause genev was near the border of france ... Everyone spoke english... And french ... Even thou every one spoke english... I still wanted to learn.. French .... Cause hopefullyyy ... In the future i can live either in france or swizterland ... Thats my goal .... I will keep u posted .... ;-D####$$##%POSITIVE
this course is too expensive!! is for rich people####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok very good, I'm very excited!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
ust started the French version, Rosetta Stone makes things easier but it totally takes time!####$$##%POSITIVE
good times for sure!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta, i checked your site.Does the complete online access for 6 months include all the five levels in German for $299 ? And would i be able to read and speak the language without much difficulty ? Do u have online exams after each level?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Sarah.  My scores have be very high but I am not sure where the prompt will come up.  Will I receive an email or will a screen pop up when I on log into Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think this is a great idea!####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't say enough great things about the whole program. :)  That's my favorite part, too!  I love how interactive they make it and how personable they are.  It really does help learn the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok thanks ####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah Chris, I had just heard a lot of good things about it and then I checked it out for myself and I liked the strategy behind it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Which is so horribly sad b/c I have a droid too and now I'm investing in an iPad just so I do RS on the go.  Ugh!  Please fix this problem RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I know that Android sales are overgoing iPhones. Besides this would be great for RS to be impartial and neutral and make all its users happy regardless of their mobile device they are using.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, so I read in the FAQ... :-( Apart from mixi, which requires a Japanese mobile e-mail address, it was the first time I saw a website require a mobile phone number. Fortunately, SharedTalk doesn't require one...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, you're right: I went through RSL's privacy policy statement, which made clear that my phone number, like the rest of my personal information, could/would be used by RSL for marketing or advertising purposes. In case of purchase or merger involving RSL, my phone number would even be sold as part of RSL's assets. BTW, I seriously doubt the software on my computers secretly steal my phone number :) Granted, Facebook is always trying to get it from me, but it's not going to happen :D####$$##%POSITIVE
spainsh some what, i don't have the money to buy it and for the other languages that you have! i would love to learn them all someday before i die, but only time will tell, also it would help our family bussiness!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have also seen a few grammar errors in Russian Level 1.  I don't remember what exersise, I will have to go back and look, but in one of them it says: "в кухне" instead of "на кухная"####$$##%NEGATIVE
I started German a few weeks ago and I love it! I hope to see you in the studio sessions!####$$##%POSITIVE
francais :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
merci####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much! That makes much more sense now. I am excited to continue my progress in Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
If I were studying japanese Id say I, good idea####$$##%POSITIVE
Good idea - I wonder if we can just announce our own "game night" for a particular language, and people just log on??####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
Je vous felicite!####$$##%POSITIVE
Jennifer, you amaze me. lol XD Where are you now on Rosetta?####$$##%POSITIVE
What did you do to fix it? I have similar problems sometimes with my mic.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Have you ever heard it spoken?!  The language is so beautiful that its like making love to the words.  Gorgeous language!  ####$$##%POSITIVE
i sent my request...thank u####$$##%POSITIVE
that actually sounds awesome! thanks everybody!####$$##%POSITIVE
Not far at all.Like I have problem findin the defnition of the words and the meaning.It just doesn't explain the meaning.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for putting the hard work and time to help me with the software.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you RS!! :D  Glad to see the list.  You should have a patch notes on the main page or on here when you add new things to the program.  This would allow others to see what hard work was completed and find it to appreciate it quicker. :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Good idea Janice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias!####$$##%POSITIVE
rworld don´t seam to have Latin...####$$##%NEGATIVE
oh thx ) in skype it is very clear and every person understood me ) I asked because 3 months ago I had a problem with the microphone and the Rosetta S. facebook profile said to me yes, exists a problem with win 7 and maybe I should to reinstall ) I reinstalled the win and it was already ok but now I don't know.. I reinstalled now the application and is the same.. but about the "harder" or not.. yes, but in 1st and 2nd level I finished with 95-100% and I think not is in it )) don't know.. I'm waiting maybe the RS has some opinions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay. Will do. Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had another Studio today (French) with VALERIE...She is an excellent coach; because it was only myself in the session we could really explore extra vocabulary and chat beyond the lessons! I LOVED IT:)   Merci .....####$$##%POSITIVE
Alex, I do not know what was going on, on Sat. when I was trying to open it up, but I tried today on Sunday and it opened up.....go figure it out...maybe it needed a Sat. off from. lol Let me know you read this and thanks again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
How ironic that a LANGUAGE company would employ folks in INDIA whose ENGLISH is sub standard!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is something I have discussed with RS staff.  They claim that they are required to go through the RS product with the pronunciation turned up to maximum difficulty.  The support staff pronunciation is good.  Actually, I think they should use the product for a language they never knew and demonstrate some proficiency.  They then would have more knowledge of the software and more empathy with those who use it.  Their language skills would improve if they talked about their use of the product among one another, using English.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Guy I talked to at Tier 2 (in Virginia) said he gets complaints ALL THE TIME about the outsourcing.  It just makes sense to have people who can communicate in the language of the caller!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
that is great James!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much for answering!! Much help :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Is excited!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks James for liking this!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta Stone for the support!####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay thanks I just wasn't sure exactly what most people do, because I  want to be successful with learning my language :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just finished Spanish (Latin America) Level 3 today.  I always did at least thirty minutes every day.  I suggest printing out the  course content for each level so if you don't have the time to log on you can still review.  The CD's are great too.  Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay thanks everyone for your advice I will definitely use it! :) ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I appreciate your help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, that would be awesome :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Congratulations.  Please keep us informed of how it goes!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm working on German as well...good luck!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Is there any way to test my own mic before going into a session, like in a test chat room?  This would at least keep me from going crazy looking for a problem that perhaps does not exist.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!  I'm using the RS provided one so but I'll have to give that a try just to be sure I'm not the true culprit.  Thanks, everyone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, guys! I'll give those suggestions a try.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! Brandi helped me and it is all working fine!####$$##%POSITIVE
I really enjoy the way rosetta stone teaches languages. It's alot better than a school or collage setting. I'll be honest, when I first thought about getting rosetta stone, I thought it was going to be like what I was acustomed to, which was conjugation tables, but instead, I've had a blast with this program!####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually I think it's ouelen because.....no maybe it is ouele.hhmmm.....spanish speakers help me out please! LOL!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta World by far and the cool games. I wish you guys had that for version 3 :(####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!  I like the games too.  They are good for testing myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome. June 28 will be epic.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Japanese as well. Have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your help! I don't know how to get a discussion board started. Do you happen to know??####$$##%POSITIVE
interesting.  thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
That’s very silly and selfish of such a lucrative company to not allow someone who has already learned volume one to pass it along to someone else, who isn't fortunate enough to be able to purchase a nearly $500 program.  What a terrible, unfortunate policy.  You should be ashamed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, just FYI, there isn't anywhere on your site that allows this so called "Payment plan" - I just tried to see how much it would be and it never offered me anything of the sorts - just something to check out and fix before you tell people about something that doesnt exist.####$$##%NEGATIVE
it's not there. just checked.  I would re-check.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love having to learn to say the words with the voice recognition system. That just amazes me how much I've learned about German grammar and how to say things just by doing that:)####$$##%POSITIVE
It's kind of hard to get away from the software and go outside :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the help! I feel more confidant now. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
You'll do awesome Sandra! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Just got back...it went great. was surprised I remembered so much####$$##%POSITIVE
The best advice I can give, besides what what is posted above, is to relax. You are not going to be criticized for not knowing. The coaches are extremely helpful. Most of all, just do your best. You will remember it...and the games before hand don't hurt either. ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
It was fun, but it is really annoying when other people don't really know what they're doing and they waste time. One person kept on boncing in and out of the session it got really annoying. The learning was good though, however one person knew what they were doing and knew the material, so it wasn't that bad.####$$##%POSITIVE
I really enjoy the sessions, so Michelle I recommend a bunch of them!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the studio sessions, for the most part.  Yesterday, I was the only student, so I got to talk more.  IF people are not prepared for the session, it does take away from it.  I have to emphasize a difference between those who are not prepared, and those who are just having a hard time getting the words out.  I know that I fall in the latter category!####$$##%POSITIVE
I like that too! It really helps you express yourself in the new language. You can also see where you need work!####$$##%POSITIVE
One coach I have just points to each picture and says , "what is she wearing, what color is it" etc. and never personalizes it and it is so boring . I always am disappointed when I get her. However two that I have are so much fun. We always laugh and the time flies by and other students say funny things when they get a change to talk, and we learn many new words and still do the lesson. I said this before but I must reiterate, Marcus and Elaine are EXCELLENT, FUN coaches!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
The best part was when I wanted to say something I didn't know the words for in spanish.  I had to figure out a different way to answer the question using the words I do know.####$$##%POSITIVE
Swedish is awesome!  My boyfriend speaks rather fluent Swedish because he lived in Sweden for several years.  If you have a question about the language than hit me up.  He can't really help you with the Rosetta Stone product though.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is always very helpful with tech issues during Studio.  Without a doubt, it is a strong point of their customer service.####$$##%POSITIVE
The tech service is excellent.  I am still unsure why the time was changed on the session, but I am hoping the issue has been fixed, we will see next time.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi. I'm about to use everything except the game Prospero. I'm getting an error message "an error has occurred. The window will close now."####$$##%NEGATIVE
Other than that, your software is awesome! I especially love the studio sessions! <3####$$##%POSITIVE
That is so good to hear Muñequito Castillo . I am planning on eventually getting RS French but I wasn't sure how much I would learn. I already have a book in French and many DVD's that I can watch in French.####$$##%POSITIVE
Am buying French level 1 on Monday.....so excited!####$$##%POSITIVE
It isnt 2 hard to learn.. I love learning Spanish!! Its a pretty amazing language! A little confusing at times####$$##%POSITIVE
if anyone wants to have a native spanish speaking friend be free to add me, i can help you guys to learn spanish and practice it...btw im learning french####$$##%POSITIVE
He thinks it's awesome and is really excited. Can't wait for it to arrive!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't have a Hebrew font, but am excited I can read it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone I no longer like you since you removed yourself from the e-army learning. Greedy bastards.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just finished my Arabic studio class.my teacher Hassna was great. I hope she didn't mind that some crazy student is bothering her during Christmas day.####$$##%POSITIVE
I really enjoyed it.it was only me and my teacher.she spoke quite fast but I was surprised how much I understand. I'm getting quite confident in my new language.I'm just finishing level 1.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing quite well with it. Currently on Level 3, Unit 3. Sometimes I have to do a lesson a couple of times, or ask a German friend to explain something to me. But, together with a good dictionary, I find the CD programme and the iPhone app extremely efficient. I'm learning more than I ever did in a language class.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks guys.####$$##%POSITIVE
German is very easy to learn since you're a native speaker of English. Give it a try, you'll like it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I started German about 30 years ago, and just started back a couple of years ago. I can say that German is not the easiest language to learn.  Unlike English, you have different word order in some cases (after dass and weil), and you have to decline nouns.  Learning any language is difficult because you are generally "replacing" your existing vocabulary in English with another one.  Like any language, you can do RS, but you really have to supplement your learning with audio/visual (movies, music, internet) and use the language (over the internet, face-to-face).####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys so much.I really want to learn German and Learn more about the culture my family roots are German.Kiser####$$##%POSITIVE
You know, they have the Totale online program for only $20 a month for 12 months. I called in one day to ask a question and they gave me this option. I love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I ordered Japanese language for my  Christmas present.  Thank you Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok. Next sale I'll just have to go to the airport...Thanks so much for replying!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! :  )####$$##%POSITIVE
Merry Christmas, Rosetta Stone employees. Thank you for all that you do.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone sucks! Happy Birthday Jesus! Rosetta stone still sucks!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is a great program, I can easily learn French when I never knew a word before it...It is easy to learn and easy to remember!  Thanks Rosetta Stone, and a Merry Christmas to all!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello there !where can i get rosetta stone in gdl for english ?thank 2####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a cable channel, I will pay attention to which one next time. The volume is at a normal level until about the last 15- 20 seconds when announcing the phone #. It is so LOUD that it startles  anyone in the room. We either switch the station or mute it when the ad comes on.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Happy Holidays to you too!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the sessions too. I have a session later tonight at 9:30pm. I can't wait. I also have one tomorrow scheduled.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. がんばって。I got Japanese with them and am currently up to Level 2 unit 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just love the japanese Culture. I wanna move there eventually and maybe be a translater or an english tutor or something =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats to both of you. I do own the RS German set. I shall be starting February or March. I need to finish Japanese first.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck.  I have similar goals in different languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Donald ..... You have help me so much with a better understanding...... I will be purchasing one soon####$$##%POSITIVE
You welcome, I have LA Spanish and its money well spent, I love it, and I believe you will too.####$$##%POSITIVE

I never liked it..... but now I'm seeking to embrace it.... took me 30yrs......  to love my name......####$$##%POSITIVE
Now thats Awesome...... Good Luck to you!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Congrats! I am so close to level 3 in Japanese but since it's the last level I'm taking my time.####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 1 - unit 3... I am a newbie :) Congrats on your progress! How long did it take you to get to L3?####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to learn Spanish because I feel locked away that I only know 1 language and spanish is nice and round. Lovely.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sean, I want to put the characters on my keyboard, but my keyboard is black and the stickers and clear and black. Shucks. :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had the same problem, what I did was made a prinout of a keyboard layout and put the Hebrew letters where they are located on the keyboard. Takes a little time to get used to, but it's possible. if yo want it i can send it to you in PDF.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just finished off lesson 1. Its pretty cool. It definitely was my first time ever using Rosetta stone. Thanks for the advice####$$##%POSITIVE
At least some every day with RS, but in best practice, I mutter to myself througbhout the day and chat (as much as i can in the language) at work...Basics like colors, hot/cold, food, hello and some of the formal/informal greetings you can use a lot through the day, and most often someone knows the languae and will speak back at you, even if you don't understand...####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it is, and mines run out next week and I wont be able to afford it, so I am glad I have the CD's.####$$##%POSITIVE
the games are fun and all but i can manage just fine on my own for those prices...lol I am starting over anyway i did unit 1 & 2 of russian but when school started for kids things got very busy, so i just reset all my scores and i am going to restart tomorrow..hehehe####$$##%POSITIVE
i have it it is fun, i am starting over though..got super busy with the kids and school and now i forgot everything...lol####$$##%POSITIVE
I have Russian i am almost done with Unit 4 of the first CD. You will love it! Я люблю Русский язык!####$$##%POSITIVE
I meant it doesn't show any English. there's no way to even learn it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay, well I don't get it. I'll try to learn more for a few day but I'f it still doesnt work I'll sadly return it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah but for example I was clicking it and they show people cooking but it doesn't say they are cooking the men are cooking ....it's confusing####$$##%NEGATIVE
You would be better off using Mango Languages. Easier to use then Rosetta  Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed. Returning Rosetta stone , doesn't work.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck####$$##%POSITIVE
yeah at first its kinda easy but it gets hard but its also interesting and thanks ^W^####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 2 was a pain in the butt.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh yeah your right about that! Yeah I got it. I'm going to return it though for a refund. I haven't even opened the package up yet!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Because I can't afford to keep it####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm halfway through level 2 of Japanese.  I'm glad I have made it so far but it's almost over.####$$##%POSITIVE
I sure will, thanks. =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Why don't I hear sound in my headphones?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just got to Russian CD 2 today. I've come a long way i feel like i can go to Russia and get around just fine. Can't wait to conquer this language! lol####$$##%POSITIVE
Got the headset working thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Been there done that and will probably so it some more lol. But my instructors are so nice and make me feel confident no matter how much I keep getting key and bowl mixed up in german lol####$$##%POSITIVE
I just downloaded a dictionary app on my ipad, so while I'm working on Rosetta Stone lessons, I can look up a word, get all the information and make notes.  I am a very visual learner, so I hope this will help. Next step is buying a dictionary in book form!  My vocabulary is much larger, and I can understand the speakers on RS, and I've started to think in Italian, searching for the words when I see something that I think I can name.  This learning method is fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am in awe! How many languages do people learn here? Are you able to converse properly with native speakers in their countries? Have I joined a cult? if so, it sounds like the best one yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
even when its a prompt i say everything out loud as i pick it. saying it repeatedly helps.####$$##%POSITIVE
william the online help is amazing! i had a issue hearing my instructor in a studio and the Success team helped me right away.####$$##%POSITIVE
how is 10% off an unbelievable discount! that's closer to no discount at all!####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's "Unbelievable".####$$##%POSITIVE
Considering Rosetta Stone programs were THOUSANDS of $$$ at one time and are now HUNDREDS of $$$  Why you complaining about prices and discounts?  Consider it a BLESSING.  It's a great program for learning another language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Still overpriced for us mortals, in these financially-strapped times!  It's been on my wish list for many years now, and for several languages, as well!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think the 10% is on top of other discounts they have implemented recently. Kip I was able to get totale 4 for less than $40 a month over six months. That is something I could afford instead of coming up with couple hundred dollars at once.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't see it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry, can't find it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Found it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much! I received the needed activation, and now it appears everything's working! I appreciate it very much, and now my laptop is the all in one resource I always wanted. I am so driven to learn the Japanese language, a way to use lessons on trips was something I always wanted! Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone, I figured out how to add language levels since I have all 5 Volumes (Levels).  Thank you very much for your help.####$$##%POSITIVE
Spanish (Latin) its great and i love it ! The demo is great thank you so much rosetta stone (gracias) lol####$$##%POSITIVE
Cedar Point is THE BEST!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Jeremiah- I used the online access (studio & games) for the first 3 months, up to the middle of level 3, but did not renew it.  It probably would have been good to continue, but I didn't want to pay extra for that.  However, I must say, having taken a German Tutor outside RS was a much better investment than paying extra for Studio.  The tutor was able to answer the questions that RS wasn't.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for posting that Mykle, I have lost of similar thoughts that are in your OP. I also agree with Janice and am very aware I will have to do way more than the RS course to become fluent...which I'm planning to do once I've finished. I've just completed L3U2 so am half-way through...and still loving it!####$$##%POSITIVE
See my note above. It's a good base, but I highly doubt you'll be fluent.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've called at various times throughout the year and it's been no different.  The thing that truly frustrated me was that I called the "purchase now" line and someone speaking perfect English picked up on the second ring.  The moment he found out I was a returning customer I was put on hold fora half hour so that I could speak to  someone who doesn't speak much English.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ummm... how were you planning to get a hold of me?  I've been checking my e-mail as well as here but nothing...####$$##%NEGATIVE
wow thanks, rosetta stone is pretty fun I like how it makes you think when it throws things at you that you don't know####$$##%POSITIVE
You know, my cousins called my grandma vita and my son calls her yaya but Rosetta Stone is supposed to teach the proper language that's all I'm saying####$$##%NEGATIVE
First I am not learning Spanish I learned Spanish as a small child from my grandmother which is a native speaker. Also while some words may change by the country there are proper words for everything. My point being if we could all just make up words then there would be no use in learning a language.  I could come up with so many words across the world for a grandmother but they aren't all proper.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree Janice it's just about misrepresentation they shouldn't have translated it as such. What if someone didn't know better and said it as such another person could be confused by it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes Ben I read all the comments and was already aware of that though as I said that wasn't my point I being Puerto Rican raised in a bilingual household have heard many names in Spanish for a grandmother my argument was that it was translated as such as if the company is teaching it that way. I only wanted it clarified and it has been by the company in the comment above.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Sean :) -just saw that. Do you by chance know of any type of sharing/recycling community? It's so expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Donald Zimmerman is learning it - and doing a good job.####$$##%POSITIVE
Understandable, I just thought perhaps there was maybe some type of co-op or online community. Guess I'll start saving my pennies! :) Thanks for your help.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your time, both of you. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
wow great!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
oh, ok thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
so if i want 3 months i can't get it####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got it last year for christmas and it's great! Hope you do well!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I appreciate it .. thanks:)!! ive really gotta learn more of this language recently .. thank you guys again!####$$##%POSITIVE
I speak Korean. If you have questions, let me know. I'll be glad to help out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I'm doing Korean now.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone!!! I guess what made me interested in learning Korean, Rachel, is that I've always admired Korea. I want to teach English in foreign countries and my top country is South Korea! I love the korean culture, food, language, entertainment etc etc! I'm very excited to begin learning the language and eventually moving there! :]####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
4 of us. And thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Sold :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Interesting...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the information Bernadetta. I received a call just a few minutes ago from Rosetta Stone. The representative's name was Jessica, she called regarding my previous post and was very helpful. Apparently there is a downloadable version of level 1 French and she will be sending me a link to the product.  I was obviously fustrated last night but have since calmed down and now am impressed by the company's customer service today.  Thank you Rosetta Stone and thank you Jessica!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm extremely interested in Mandarin too. I was supposed to get it this year but I still haven't made up my mind on the language I should do next. Logically it should be Mandarin because I took classes in it.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you1####$$##%POSITIVE
I made keyboard cutouts for mine. hehe.####$$##%POSITIVE
я изучаю по-русский также! and yes, i received stickers####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks. As long as they make paint markers I'm good to go. Oh and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the buz bingo. It one of the coolest games I've played. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow, great answers! I just liked RS on FB and am seeing a lot of great conversations already. Thanks for posting!####$$##%POSITIVE
Great to hear.####$$##%POSITIVE
I was there, you were awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I was there too, Simy. You did great :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I was there!  Thanks Simy!####$$##%POSITIVE
I made it too. Good job all around. ####$$##%POSITIVE
It was a great  webinar! You and Christine were both great!####$$##%POSITIVE
My heritage on my dads side actually. And my 16 or 17 birtday present from my family is a trip to Italy for a couple weeks. And hopefully maybe one day live in Italy for a little while. I really want to do Foreign Exchange in Junior year. That would be a great experience.####$$##%POSITIVE
crazy and expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your quick replies! So I guess, I am re-doing the core lessons in Level 1 and that will get me back on the track to continue with Level 2 in Standard mode. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks I just want to learn to start expressing my self already and wanted to know if any body had any tips ####$$##%POSITIVE
Alright! Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank You very much Geoffrey for answering my question. Its good to know when people have had success learning a new language such as Arabic. Now that I know a little more about the program from some one who has used it I soon will be making my purchase.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
The demo for japanese looks perfect, すごい ね‼ Could you also supply me with a link to a demo for Korean, my family and I also interested in purchasing Rosetta stone Korean. 度もありがとございます!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have used Rosetta Stone in my classroom as a teacher and I have used Rosetta Stone at home to learn third and fourth languages.  I had Rosetta Stone v. 3, so I can't speak about v. 4.  Additionally, I speak romance languages and have very limited experience with Asian languages.  I really like Rosetta Stone.  Keep in mind this is an immersion program.  It will not provide you with direct instruction on grammar.  I find myself consulting other sources to find out the whys.  Receptive skills are acquired first in language learning so you will read and understand more than you will be able to write and speak.  Be patient, but you can learn all of these skills through Rosetta Stone.   Hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Eric. I am currently learning japanese with Rosetta Stone. I have fun learning japanese. I did learn languages in a classroom setting before(spanish and italian) but my japanese has gotten further beyond them. I love speaking to japanese natives(in rosetta world). They always told me that my japanese is soo good! It's been three months now and I learn soo much japanese compared to what I learn with a year with italian(classroom setting). Go ahead and learn a language with Rosetta Stone! I never regretted from buying this program.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Arabic and French and it is absolutely outstanding.  Realistically I could not take a classroom course and tapes or books alone would not cut it.   I can read, write, speak, converse, understand.   I also can review my languages more efficiently than learning from scratch.   This is important to stay sharp when you don't use it every day.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you everybody for the feedback, thanks Jennifer for the feedback on the experiebce with japanese language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Eric...I`m studying Mandarin with Rosetta Stone. Just started about 3 weeks ago; still on Level 1 Unit 1 but I`m excited with so much I`ve learned. I also take French w/ RS and I love it. Comparisons are always unfair; but yes; the chinese alphabet makes the language harder to learn than French (but not impossible) ! GO FOR IT !####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you Juliana,####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that is right.  Go to iTunes and read the reviews about the app for iTouch and iPhone.  It is very helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christy, thanks for getting back to me about this.  I am running the box version of RS and have ensured (as windows and my programs do) to give RS complete access to the net.   I'll take a double look again tonight when I get home.  I shall call for second level support if I don't find the issue   ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I study 'cause I want talk with many people in the world. I'm in 1st unit in all... :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning both and find them both to be easy.####$$##%POSITIVE
If you start one language, get a good start in that one, then start the other.  Also, maybe get a book of the characters of the language that you will start second, and study that so that you can get a good start when you do start RS with that language.  Good luck and have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Jen, Janice, Trevor. what language have you done? Thanks again all.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think there good I havnt had much time for it recently but there really useful####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't wait for us to play together in Rosetta World! I am currently learning japanese as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Haha love it####$$##%POSITIVE
I love it. I'm on Level 2, beginning unit 3. Level 2 has been the most challenging so far. Studio sessions, studio sessions...that's my advice. My reading comprehension has soared. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Swedish is really really fun to learn! : D And Rosetta does an amazing job of teaching it. If English is your first language, you'll pick it up real fast!####$$##%POSITIVE
I actually enjoy all of them but Speaking is my favorite, the voice recognition is one of the best features Rosetta Stone has, it is very accurate & helpful :))####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, by the end of the year :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm a poor college student with a job at Burger King. Even with a payment plan, I can't afford it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was just thinking about how much more I'm enjoying level 2 of French, so I'm glad to hear that it just keeps getting better.####$$##%POSITIVE
Many Many thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone Rocks :) Super Super Super Like :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is best####$$##%POSITIVE
I started learning for a Polish Girl :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosseta Stone is awesome ####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Polish its hard catagory 5 lanuae but i do very well my boyriend ad my Polish frieds are suprised how I can prenounce and speak Polish. Polish is my favorite launguage.:)####$$##%POSITIVE
The studios are great because they only use the material that you have learned - nothing else.  There is a great sense of accomplishment when you understand what is said in your target language.  It gives you immense confidence, and that is exactly what one needs to continue learning a foreign language - encouragement!####$$##%POSITIVE
the application cd keeps ejecting from my drive and doesn't read it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i spent an inordinate amount of time with several support people trying to fix the problem.  no luck at all.  berlitz it is.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Odd... It works just fine on my Macbook.  May be a hardware issue? I dunno.  Sad day for you Del! Rosetta Stone is amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
I donit have a Mac but I have found Rosetta Stone customer servıce to be outstandıng.  And, the language program is exceptional.  I would keep working with RS; I bet there is a solution short of returning the program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Del, from all you say - I think the CD itself just happens to be physically defective and getting a replacement for it will put things right.  It's unfortunate that support did not go for the most obvious answer, but these things happen.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As Geoffrey said, tier 1 support is terrible.  If I get problems, I ask for tier 2 support right away.  I've normally done the things tier 1 tries to put you through. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
great idea Janice!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am in Unit 3, Level 3 and it has really solidified the knowledge that I learned in university classes.  I LOVE studio - speaking the language is the most important thing for me.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm just wrapping up Level 2 Unit 1 and having great fun! I agree, Studio is awesome####$$##%POSITIVE
Great! It´s nice to know that there is other people enjoying the lessons as well! :)  Tschüss!!####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm on level 1 unit 3 lesson 3 and having so much fun. Studio is the best part, but I enjoy it all!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am working on Level 1, unit 3.  I'm loving it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey man, thanks! And It is just frustrating, when I know I am saying the word correctly, because I keep hitting the replay button for the voice, and there is one small thing with the way that I am saying it I guess, but it is just frustrating at times. But thanks! No one said learning a new language was going to happen over night! How many RS languages have you learned? This is my first one.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for all of your help guys and girls!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree that signing up for more than one studio at the same level helps you learn the concepts and have more confidence in speaking.  I take at least 2 studios at the same level/unit.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I realized what happend after I posted. Since the activation code was on the outer box on the part that opens up I mist have not seen it so we threw away the box:( and since it was Christmas everything was really hectic. I don't what to try to get a fake one since l did purchase it. But the placement of the card was very poor!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Haha yeah. That would be beat. Thank you so much for your help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you I used the demo and I love I I hope I can get activation!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love it.   It's great.  I had 5 years of classroom French in HS and College - in a good school and this is better for learning the language.  Faster, less effort, more fun.    Of course the literature and other things that come in at more advanced levels - not so much but that you can do through more normal channels.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you SO much!  You've influenced my decision. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I did the same thing.  I've now completed all five levels.  Start with 1.  You will probably go through it quick but it will be useful review and you will do better at the later levels since they build on what was in the previous one.  I will also say that a level is about equal to a year in school ... but much faster to learn even if you never knew the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
To reiterate, though I had 5 years of French - and no question the early levels were review - they were not even remotely boring, there was new stuff to learn and stuff to relearn.  Also, I think the RS system is better.  I always spoke French sort of Quebecois because of one of my teachers.   I think my pronunciation is getting better than ever with the RS tools.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Geoffrey and Tracie. I will start with Level 1. I am sure i need some review. I also had 5 years but it has been 20 years since I took it so it will be good to refresh some. Thanks again.####$$##%POSITIVE
YES......... YOU`LL LOVE I:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Awww, Thanks Guys Sure Will####$$##%POSITIVE
@Janice: correct! That's the one. Very useful:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Congratulations!! I just started Level 1 Unit 1 for Spanish (Latin America) and I have all 5 levels! :) would you say that doing all 5 makes you close to being fluent?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! If fluent means speaking without thinking too hard about it, then yes, I'm close. I still have to think very hard about gender and structure, but that will get better with practice. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
And good luck with Spanish! :) I'm about to start five levels of that as well!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just started German this month and have so far gotten to level 1 unit 3 lesson 3. I'm really impressed with how much I can already say & understand. I hope I can keep my enthusiasm as much as you have & make it through all 5 levels. You are an inspiration!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Jessica I'm sure you can! It's so fun and effective, too! Thanks for the compliment, and good luck! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Arabic is great and surprisingly easy to learn with RS####$$##%POSITIVE
Arabic is a ridiculously cool language to learn. I had four hours tuition when I did my teaching English course and wanted to carry on learning it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you all for your extremely helpful and valued opinions.  I decided to start my journey of learning new languages with Arabic.  You all provided great responses, which helped me make my final decision.  Earlier today, I made the purchase of the Arabic version, and hopefully I will enjoy the teaching format Rosetta Stone utilizes so that in the near future, the Chinese version will soon be added to my new foreign language collection as well.  Thank you all once again!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just attended my first online session. Loved it! Olga was great!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Geoffrey, @Rosetta Stone,  ok, I found on support.rs.com and I read on internet now and I think will be better anyway if I will learn 4 and 5 ) english is not mandarin and every word which will I learn will help me in further coz it's a universal language ) thx for answers.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great, had no idea.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I will! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Interesting observations!####$$##%POSITIVE
this happens to me sometimes! i just restart the whole slide####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh alright thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, i do  apriciate the info. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
@Alex - I LOVE the YOUTUBE clip!  Actually, I would love to learn Romulan so I could get involved with treaty negotiations between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.  It might prove fruitful and I could stretch my diplomatic and legal skills!  Besides, I like to travel!####$$##%POSITIVE
good idea. thanks  i cant wait to start####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks for the info.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone. I will inquire further with Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Aaron, thank you. This is the information I received when I called yesterday and placed my order. My wife and I are really looking forward to getting started :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I will!!! I cant wait to get started!! I see you noticed i wrote my name in the Cyrillic alphabet.. My name is Myona..and i will keep you posted on my progress! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
DO NOT BOTHER with The German!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sure, it would have been nice to include a dictionary, since your product introduces words that you have NO idea what it is!####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Alex.  Thank you very much (and very good customer service BTW).  I've tried to down load the initial cd, and after the initial cd it asks for the next - the next CD, that will not even acknowledge that a CD was ever put in.  So I'd try several times to remove application, and then re-apply the application - just in case... to no avail.  I will email you directly with the specifics by tomorrow.  Thanks again! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's it! :D  It was when I was prompted to add a language level - that was when it would not recognize any of the CDs that followed.  If I go into "My Computer" and then to the CD:// drive - it is listed there.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am not happy with The German, at all!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You didn't have Swahili already? Thats great! I know a few people who are going on a mission trip and the native people speak Swahili. Thats grace right there! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I wasn't able to attend :(.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was very cool with some cool info and great that we could talk and ask questions. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks - I am in the UK so not sure we have "mall kiosks" and unfortunately Farsi only available here as online course but will have a look at another demo. Thanks again####$$##%POSITIVE
i like bahasa indonesia,coz i'm from indo####$$##%POSITIVE
Finally getting out my rossetta stone french again! Haven't even finished level 1 D:! Means i still have 4 1/2 more to go!####$$##%POSITIVE
Still no Finnish..so not listening!!!! :'(((####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
wow####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the one for Portuguese and I think it is great!####$$##%POSITIVE
I played it two days ago with no problems ####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be lovely; I also just sent another email to email help, it is ref # 14006-2271619.  Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just received it, so I am only on lesson four of level one. I am always up for joining up on a Facebook group or somthing for practice ####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool, I will try to make a facebook group and add link? I haven't made a FB group before, but assume thats easier than email groups.####$$##%POSITIVE
PS I am "only" on level 1, as well. I just figure that besides RS learning and studio, all the ways I can "whole learn" by spontaneously using language helps me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sounds good! I can make a group if you don't want to or don't know how, I have done it before, just let me know####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank-you.  Happy New Year.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think its working out pretty good, its money well spent.####$$##%POSITIVE
Not in the US, haha!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hahahaha... But it's not important i tell you happy new year and Wishing you a year filled with peace and love! ♥####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, happy New Year! :) Ours will come eventually, haha.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah come eventually ^_^ hahahaha... :D :D####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Netflix now. I have gotten so many foreign language movies due to them. But yeah my studying does come first. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's a very hard question to answer.  I like getting different perspectives while learning a language so I have A LOT of different programs.  Rosetta Stone is addicting, and fun.  While waiting for lunch today I was on the android app.  I love Rosetta World.  My favorite game is Buzz Bingo.  I got to try Meta Tag yesterday but didn't know how to change the keyboard from phonetic to true Russian so it was very slow going.  Any ideas on that?  I do like how it tracks your progress and won't let you play a game above your skill level.  I wish I could play them on the android too (hint hint)  I also love how it makes you speak and think rather than a passive learning where you can become lazy and just listen.  And it teaches how to read along with speaking.  Breaking down words is used in other programs but seeing it broken down along with hearing it that way makes it so much easier.  Sometimes no matter how hard you try to listen, it's still difficult to tell some letters apart.  Sorry I babbled there's just way too much I like about this program I don't have a favorite.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like it all####$$##%POSITIVE
Ohhh ok thank you very much!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I got my package this past Thursday!! Thank you for your help!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Did my first one today and was on my own so its like one to one tuition! Love it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I did. Hope to see it soon ####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow you guys are brave lol I have my hands full learning Spanish I couldn't imagine learning Mandarin very complex but good luck ####$$##%POSITIVE
Haha, Thanks Eric! I was going to wait a year to study an oriental language, but when my friend offered to study with me and split the price... well, that was an offer I couldn't refuse!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Honey####$$##%POSITIVE
Happy New Year.............####$$##%POSITIVE
yes####$$##%POSITIVE
Happy New Year!####$$##%POSITIVE

The HD app for iPad is different from the iPhone one. The iPad app has the full course on it (excl. RW & Studio) - its good!####$$##%POSITIVE
Same thing with the Rosetta World for Spanish(Spain) there is never anyone on....I even went looking for people on here and still havent found anybody in Rosetta World and it would be so helpful but oh well .....great concept but there is never anyone on it !####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's rare I see anyone on for German. I've been on all times of the day and night. Most I've ever seen is 4. I've never seen anyone on during Games Night either. I have more success chatting away to contacts I've made during Studio sessions####$$##%NEGATIVE
German! I started it last year but had to stop because of an overly demanding schedule.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
When trying to click on the photos to answer the questions, nothing happened.  No, I did not win an extended demo.  It was on FB.  I did not see anywhere where you could "spin the wheel."  Thank you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Welcome!  I like what I saw on your site.  Thanks so much for the demo!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ah cool, that's interesting to know, thanks. I was doing about 3 hours a week since April but stopped in October when my job became manic. Ready to start again properly now. Can't wait!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hahaha!!!! Oh! Yes you are!!! Hi mate!####$$##%POSITIVE
LMAO. That's one of the funniest things I've seen on this page!####$$##%POSITIVE
silly cus lol been looking at um thats all just wanted your input just its alot dont know if I can afford it but I heard its very good ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes it is VERY good and worth every penny and at the moment they have a sale on too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Fair enough, thanks for the response!####$$##%POSITIVE
Never mind, the next day it worked fine!####$$##%POSITIVE
it's error 8118 and when I contacted support via chat they gave me numbers to call but NONE of them work and I told to "call back tomorrow" - I'm not sure that the message of "the number you called is NOT in service" will change over night do you??####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried following the directiions for error 8118 on the support website for my computer but half the instructions don't exsist! It says to delete the FLEXnet file..... Um, there is no flexnet file.... I just want to use my program properly!! Someone please help me!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like it for Norwegian lessons####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes - very good program.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's the best program, ever! For any language!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've just started French and I'm seriously impressed!####$$##%POSITIVE
this a good product####$$##%POSITIVE
J'adore le français!!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Tried Berlitz one-on-one classes but costly, intimidating, frustrating. Tried Paul Pimsleur and like his method but can only find conversational books and tapes which limit growth. My next endevour is Rosetta Stone. Sounds like everyone loves it! I just need to save the money.####$$##%POSITIVE
c'est parfait...####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Vietnamese. Great program.####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm using the spanish and i know like 50 words and its been 2 days!!!! its awesome. u r learning without even trying.####$$##%POSITIVE
They just released an Android app for several devices and have more in development.  Unfortunately not for my phone so it is still Dutch and Portuguese free :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
they are doing a good job nd trying to fix the mix up, they were  very helpful and polite which i really appreciated.####$$##%POSITIVE
It was a lot of fun.  Leather some new stuff, reviewed some stuff I already knew, and saw a lot of stuff I should have known. Had fun doing it too. The instructor was a cool guy too. I'm looking forward to my next one already.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't, it's not part of RS. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's a pirate site, they are not part of RS nor do they have actual real programs.  RS does not yet have an Australian website.  You have to order through the US site (or one of others that you can navigate to from the real site) and have it shipped if you want to purchase from RS####$$##%NEGATIVE
how is that helpful? It's like I wanna learn German. Ich kann nicht learn the language in pieces. I love my Rosetta Stone in German btw.. the complete set.. Also having the coaches is the best.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ich lerne Deutsch....und Ich liebe Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Joanna Conrath, go to the Rosetta Stone website & sign up for alerts if possible, I receive emails letting me know about current specials/sales. There was a recent (unfortunately now expired) offer for Rosetta Stone Totale Lvl 1-5 package, normal price $750, on sale for $399 & available for 5-pay installment, which brings pmts to $80 or so per month. I had to go that route but it's SOOOO worth it. I tried other methods for learning Spanish & none have been 1/2 as effective as Rosetta Stone... Looking forward to mastering Spanish & off to a pretty good start & then moving on to French, German, or Chinese (maybe all 3, lol!)####$$##%POSITIVE
this thing is beast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   pio tong seee####$$##%NEGATIVE
Love French ...I hope to use Rosetta Stone to brush up more on spoken French:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Just started the french program, very happy with it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
JUst started the Latin American Spanish, and really am enjoying it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sure! I will let you know how I get on as I have never done a single lesson in Spanish. Whereas French, my previous RS course, I already knew quite a bit from high school. But I trust the RS method so I'm sure I will be fine! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
German and I love it...####$$##%POSITIVE
Good idea... I'll have to try and do that in Hindi as I'm able :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I already have tried everything on the link you posted, and have also submitted a ticket. Also I called the help line and was left on hold for half hour. Then I left a message and was told someone would be in touch but they haven't. I shall take a look at this live chat tomorrow morning. Thanks for the info Yazmir, I hope for an outcome like yours!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much for the info!  I will be ordering my new headset next week!####$$##%POSITIVE
hELLO Patton, How are you?, Rosetta stone is wonderfull, I think so.####$$##%POSITIVE
Im doing spanish too. Its pretty awesome.####$$##%POSITIVE
I also just spent over 20 minutes on hold with customer service before giving up (there's no wait time or number in line while on hold, and I have limited minutes).  I'm very disappointed right now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree. Studios are my favorite part of Rosetta Stone. I've taken them all more times than I can count--I finished all 5 levels months ago, but I still take several studios a week just to practice speaking. The French coaches are all wonderful and I learn something new every time.####$$##%POSITIVE
My daughter loved the demo CD, so we went with French... they do have a homeschooling addition too####$$##%POSITIVE
Mine loves it.####$$##%POSITIVE
i have same problem, i have done everything is says to do on that link but nothing is working :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Salut. Merci bien pour votre reponse! :) J'aime RS bien! Hi, thank you for the answer/encouragement. I like RS very much! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow you are lucky last time I did a studio session there were 4 people in it I would love my sessions to. Be 1 on 1 ####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi. to be honest, i haven't used the program as much as i would like to, but so far i like it. however, i speak some thai already, and have had thai grammar lectures, and i am not sure if i would have liked the rosetta stone method if i was a beginner. I t has however broadened my vocabulary and i look forward to start using it again! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
America needs a better foreign language system in schools. I am learning german with rosetta stone right now and I have learned so much and I have decided to become an exchange student in Germany for one year. I am so excited to leave and experience a new culture and I know that I am more than confident to speak in German because of rosetta stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
It would help to learn one that u could use i speak 3 and do nothing with it:(  but i dont go out of my way to try either. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm already bilingual and totally excited to have started learning Mandarin Chinese with Rosetta Stone!  It would be awesome to be a hyperpolyglot but I doubt that anyone can be truly fluent in a language unless they have lived in the country in which it is the primary language. ####$$##%POSITIVE
this page i mean :)####$$##%POSITIVE
i assumed so too, but it's not there####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Murt...look at the buttom of this page on the Left, right below Rosetta Stone's 'likes" it states: "Create a Page...."   if you see in that column word "Unlike" then you probably already liked this page before, without realizing it.  Hope it helps:)####$$##%POSITIVE
aha!  that was it :)  I should've realized that since I've been wanting Rosetta Stone for quite awhile and my boyfriend got it for me for Christmas !####$$##%POSITIVE
The file is blank.  This is not at all what I would expect from a "home school" program.  Suppose I had two or three children or even just one for that matter whom I was/were home schooling.  The complete loss of all progress files would not only be a major disappointment and inconvenience, but could affect my record keeping and performance reporting requirements with the state.  There should be a protected record back-up file that truncates rather than overwrites the data.  A first year programming student could easily do this.  It would be a marvelous value-added function for RS users.  Please consider it.  I am still very disappointed that this happened because of a faulty update from Rosetta Stone.  Not at all acceptable considering the RS reputation and price.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm learnin French (Level 2) and Spanish (Level 1) now. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!!####$$##%POSITIVE
TITA is typical for AUNTIE in SPAIN.  I know plenty of ppl who are from Mexico and they are even wondering why that was up there.  To them TITI is more AUNT and never heard ANYONE say TITA.. Also if you are teaching a LANGUAGE teaching SLANGS of that language instead of teaching the ACTUAL PROPER terms is a bit silly to me.. especially for the money they attempt to get ppl to pay####$$##%NEGATIVE
But why would you only use a "slang" or abbrev term that is ONLY used in ONE country when that language is widely spoken in numerous countries along with numerous dialects?  But even if they do that in the software... using it in a commercial to advertise the product is a bit foolish.  I know in my native language there are various dialects from different regions but you should never introduce slang or regional terms unless you are at a HS speaking level.  Learning the fundamentals of a language and then learning what is more "acceptable" for everyday use/daily conversation is more practical IMO.  Most total submersion classes which actually produce ADVANCE speakers actually never advocate this program since it never gives actual explanations as to why they are using said verb forms etc etc.  I am not hating on the program itself since it seems to help many ppl.  I just think they should revise that commercial since it doesn't seem to give them a validated claim for how great their software should be.####$$##%NEGATIVE
OK. Nice to know there are more options than the demo lets on####$$##%POSITIVE
don't get me wrong... so far i LOVE the program and the fact that it uses pictures to enhance learning.   Last night when my boyfriend asked me what words i learned, i saw the picture in my head and the word followed !  Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Seriously, this is not a good scheme. Learn Spanish out of interest in Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both!! I will try the app first!!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I would like to purchase this once we get more settled into a new house####$$##%POSITIVE
I am still on hold on the phone!  Some agent from a call center in India wasted my time and then transferred me to another hold Hell for a tech.  This is what customers detest####$$##%NEGATIVE
no error message..just Failure at the end####$$##%NEGATIVE
trying the online download...says 2hrs####$$##%NEGATIVE
Alex, it is now 30 mins later (since my last EMAIL to you) and the download not only has not finished but now it say 25 mins!  Something is wrong.  Should you call me on my land line?####$$##%NEGATIVE
No but Alex did over the phone...he called me here in Spain and remotely had to reconfigure some things.  download was getting hung up at a certain point.  He was great.  Too bad my first encounter with customer service was not as good as Alex.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rock on Alex!!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you very much! i will further look into it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
that is wonderful advise! thank you very much. ill more than likely go with japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the tip. Actually I completed level 1 in the first two weeks. Now I'm on level 2 unit 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
We got it for Christmas.......check out the website.####$$##%POSITIVE
We are learning Italian..... : )####$$##%POSITIVE
k thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Italian. I also purchased mine at Christmas. It is several hundred dollars off of what the price was even a couple of years ago,for a complete set. Well worth it considering the reinforcement and support that you get. (Good luck) BUONA FORTUNA!####$$##%POSITIVE
I was there Simy. You did a good job.Nice to meet you. I am studying Italian, but would also like to learn Spanish at some point soon. Adios!~Paula Carmichael Glacken####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning spanish, I think my coach's name was Harold...he was very nice and supportive. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually, it was that online tutorial we had last thursday that gave me the confidence to just try it and see how much I had learned so far. Although I made mistakes along the way, my coach was really supportive and it was fun talking to someone...in Spanish! ####$$##%POSITIVE
I like it. Especially when I'm on the road. I'm a traveling therapist and I'm on the road quite a bit. The app is similar to the computer version but simplified. Same type of words and picture scenarios of immersion but focused on core vocabulary. ####$$##%POSITIVE
In addition to what Francine said: You can't do the writing activities; just the speaking activities (and you can read what you're going to say.)  So that, combined with the Audio Companion, is pretty useful and handy if you're away from your computer.####$$##%POSITIVE
I asked the same question... I am currently having fun learning japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
And do you know if you'll have an upgrade from Version 3 to Version 4 TotalE (as you do on the U.S. version for $49)?  Thanks! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
What is happening with the beta testing.  I did the download, but have heard nothing since.####$$##%NEGATIVE
For developing sentences and getting a better understanding of things such as you/me/he/her/ etc. prospero is an excellent game.   It's one of my favorites to be honest.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I like the Bingo one a lot, can't remember what it's called.  It helps me to listen closely####$$##%POSITIVE
I was playing Contrasto and my partner had selected Identi. We had some audio issues so that might be why she disappeared.  It's not so easy to find partners to play with but I'll keep trying. Like studio sessions half the battle is to not be afraid.####$$##%NEGATIVE
¡Hola Nicole! Estoy aprendiendo Español con Rosetta Stone.  I personally like the CD set because 1. The course (where you learn grammar, vocab, reading writing, all that) is yours to keep - basically forever.  2. you start with anywhere from 3 to 15 months of access to Studio and World (depending on how many levels you buy; 3 months per level and it is renewable)  The only disadvantage for some people with the CD set is: you can only install the program on one computer.  That one computer can have up to 5 different learner profiles on it though (say, you, and 4 family members have their own profile)  So, its up to you and what works best for you.  As far as review: If you want to learn a language and be able to actually speak it to other natives, get Rosetta Stone.  Worth every dime and penny!####$$##%POSITIVE
lol. Ok. Thanks Geoffrey!####$$##%POSITIVE
Sometimes it just you sometimes it's 3 others... They are scary but after i'm done I always feel a sense of accomplishment. Make sure you tell us how it went####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. They can be a lot of fun. I've had many where it was just me. i prefer others but I learned a lot by myself and was able to hold a conversation with the teacher.####$$##%POSITIVE
What do you mean? You can type almost anything you need to with iPhone. There are a few Mandarin Keyboards you can enable in the phone Settings.####$$##%POSITIVE
Not if you want to write in pinyin their isnt####$$##%NEGATIVE
Um, no, there's a pinyin input, for free, built in.####$$##%POSITIVE
True there is, but you clearly haven't tried to use it else you would realize you can't type a háček with an iphone or some other diacritical tone marks. Which, are not, built in, for free...####$$##%NEGATIVE
2 if you buy the homeschool version (which offers so much more) you can make interest free payments.  To be blunt: there is NO way we could have afforded it without making the payments.  Call them and ask.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you both I REALLY appreciate all the different things to be careful of!!! Thank you so so much!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh gosh, I'm horrible haha. They're doing vocab I haven't done yet. Apparently, that's in Lesson 4..I'm in Lesson 3 haha! still fun though :)####$$##%POSITIVE
everyone, it went better than I expected! Stena was very helpful and fun to work with. I will make sure I complete the whole unit before trying studio again, just so I can contribute more to the lesson. Viele danke for the encouragements! Bis bald! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Next language (refreshing german, russian or french) I will probably go for online access. In my opinion, its the studios that are the most helpful and you get those with either.####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome. Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
In very interested I been taking Spanish levels 1-3 for almost 3 months problem is my studio sessions have been awful I really need to speak Spanish more often to really sound like I know what I'm doing so.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool. I will send a friend request to you on Facebook and after you ok it I should be able to make the group. Though its down the line, maybe some of us who like could also do some talking by Skype like in studio (or on phone) (not that I could usually correct anyone, but i figure any time we practice it helps change our brains that way.!)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes great idea I need to speak spanish with people on my level ..I live in South ,Fl and the spanish speakers here talk a mile a minute..my conversation skills are awful . I'm on unit 1, lesson 4 and I refuse to move on to unit 2 until I can speak everything and have conversations about everything in unit 1...and I feel that I'm a long ways off from that####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't like Studios because I feel that 4 people in a session is too many and I feel the coaches seem to direct  more questions to the people who seem further along ..my issue is  I just seem to go blank when put on the spot..I know many of the answers but what's in my head and what comes out of my mouth are two different things ... and I have not enjoyed the sessions thus far####$$##%NEGATIVE
D: god dang.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rachel, Thank you sooooo much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm doing Hindi and i have to say that I'm sooooooo happy because the software makes it soo easy! :) I totally recommend it####$$##%POSITIVE
Agnes and Jennifer, join the group above! Janice updates them almost daily and it now has quite a lot of members! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Cheryl,  I doing french too! How do you make the oe letter so that they squish together? I'm always getting those wrong because I can't find the right character and it's not by the other accented letters.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you.  I apprecaite it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cheryl, you're not paying enough attention.####$$##%NEGATIVE
OK, I must have missed that.  Thank you!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome idea! THANKS!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
good luck im currently taking japanese####$$##%POSITIVE
These games become quite addictive after awhile.####$$##%POSITIVE
So far my favorite is memgo.It is fun and exciting.####$$##%POSITIVE
Español . :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I like it too. I am leaning Japanese & Korean with it.####$$##%POSITIVE
me too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ipan on learning Croatian or russian so I can visit my family there :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Gefeliciteerd!####$$##%POSITIVE
good####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for all of the support guys.  I'm going to Belgium to visit my beautiful fiance.  I wish all of you the best of luck with your programs.  Just stick with it, try everyday, and I promise you will succeed.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good. I have it too.####$$##%POSITIVE
its workin now thanks! i do like the program im learning so much!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to become an English Teacher in Japan! I did not have this dream till after I came back from Japan (exchange prgram).####$$##%POSITIVE
cool im on unit one lesson two####$$##%POSITIVE
This sentence is grammatically correct.####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome, it took me the longest to understand the use of haber, now there is one thing that I still cant get the hang of, and thats the imperfect subjunctive past.####$$##%POSITIVE
Siempre he comido  - "ha" is for el, ella, Ud. Yo he, tu has. . . nosotros hemos and Uds (ellos, ellas) han.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good job otherwise! - conjugating verbs is a pain, but when you don't do it right, people notice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias Michelle.####$$##%POSITIVE
That is good. I should be starting German by March.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sehr gute Gail! Remember to always use it at every opportunity! If you don't use it, you'll lose it. :-)  Mach spaß!####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome! sehr gut! i hope to start soon! planning on going to Austria this summer!(hopefully!) :D####$$##%POSITIVE
I actually began last January 1st, 2011, and tried to work at it every day (except for being out of town here and there). It took me 1 year to do all the lessons! So if anyone really works through it, they'll learn the language! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Unfortunately it is the last level for Japanese at the moment.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I felt sad when I reached Japanese level 3 too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Joey: So far my favorite has been core lessons and study sessions. I love learning new words and I love practicing it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think so, I only knew about 3 words in spanish before I started, and now I learned so much, but dont just rely on RS, buy other resources like books, and listen to radio and watching tv in the language you learning, what language are you thinking about learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I have Korean now.####$$##%POSITIVE
I do think  that you can learn a lot through rs.  Like Donald said do not rely on just RS but it's a good start.####$$##%POSITIVE
Berlitz is good also.... and not as costly.  If you have an Ipod you can load the practice lessons on the Ipod and work on the verbal stuff while traveling.  People on the road may think you are nutz when you look like you are talking to yourself....  I bought Berlitz Spanish for me jusr so I could build on what I already know from many years ago.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You can do it. I know a 78 year old woman who learned Russian so she can talk to her daughter-in-law's mother. So you're NEVER too old to learn a new language. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
RS will get you speaking a lot faster than some of the other products out there (I have tried most of them over decades.####$$##%POSITIVE
If you want to speak, then give RS a shot.  THere is grammar, etc. but the focus is speaking - which it appears that you want more than anything.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes its important####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
i luv roseta stone! It works really well! My spanish grade wnt from an 85 to a 96 last year in just one quarter!####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome program...I'm having a blast with this....!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Whether in College or before, I think language study, particularly a second language, should seriously be integrated into all levels of education. Only now I am now realising how much I missed by denying myself the opportunity back then. Today, I'm trying to learn Spanish... It's bn fun though.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would really like to learn the German language. This would help my foreign exchange program####$$##%POSITIVE
I already have LA Spanish and I love it, and on my bday in June I am getting Brazilian Portuguese since Brazil is going to be the next economical super power, I wish they would offer more languages instead of just french, spanish, and latin, even though I am 31 and kind of started late in the game, I think its better start now than to not start at all.####$$##%POSITIVE
I really do agree with the article. I do not understand why we have to wait high school or college to start learning a new language.####$$##%POSITIVE
cool, didnt know about it.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh thanks for the info...####$$##%POSITIVE
I do that to refresh my memory. The second time around is usually much quicker.####$$##%POSITIVE
By now, I am used to reading from right to left, but the pictures moving from left to right throw me off sometimes. It would be easier and seem to make more sense if they followed the direction of the script.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It shouldn't take that much to redo things to make it go right-to-left. For the most part, It seems RS does a lot of copy and paste without regard to the language's nuances.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, I followed the steps and seemed to work better last night!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just bought 1-5 am loving it !####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks, good to know####$$##%POSITIVE
I've tried that a few different times. Nothing. :/ So I don't know if it's something else or what. I kind of give up and have skipped those.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So I have tried to re-install the program a few times and now it completely doesn't want to open the application. What in the world?This is so ridiculous and I hope I didn't just throw away $500. :( I sent a ticket in Christy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
repeat, repeat and repeat.....it does eventually sink in :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I liked to change it up a bit...use the audio companion or the iPhone app...sometimes you will get that...WOW!  I do know more than I thought.####$$##%POSITIVE
No more Rosetta. Going with different learning program####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like the mobile app####$$##%POSITIVE
So the iPhone app can run without an Internet connection, but the iPad app needs a connection? This seems backwards considering my phone almost always has Internet. Can you suggest they change that to my recommendation above?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am learning Italian.  I bought an Italian/English dictionary to help me know what the words are and it helped me improve.  Don't give up!####$$##%POSITIVE
The app needs to get on the ball and work with multitasking too. It is so annoying when I am using the app and I get a text message so I switch over to respond real fast and then switch back to the Rosetta Stone app only to have to wait for it to load again and restart what I was doing. And then I get another text. What a pain.####$$##%NEGATIVE
By the way, I really wish it was a universal app. I dislike having so many different apps to manage. Most apps on the AppStore should be universal instead of a standard and an HD version, which in a way is ironic because the iPhone 4 has a retina display and the iPad doesn't.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Lol it's the best way to learn the basis...first they show you a boy and a girl...and say the word for boy and girl then you remember that and the next part might be bot does this girl does that...you figure out 2 more words then boy does that girl does this...so if you see the boy is drinking and the girl is eating and you know the one word is boy and the other is girl you learn something. Then it will add man and woman and other things they might do. It's simple logic...all common sense matching to help your brain easily match words with persons places things ideas and actions.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh really thanks i need to gey it####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had wanted to. German is technically my first language but I haven't used it in years so I got Rosetta stone as a refresher. I just just feel like having the program, the audio CDs and the online version is redundant and wanted to see if I could use the pass to at least start another language and see I I liked it before I committed to the entire program. I wish Rosetta stone had something like that so one didn't spend so much on a language the may end up not enjoying or find too difficult to learn. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Buena Suerte con tu espanol.(Good luck with your spanish)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ummm ok.  Thanks:).  I can't wait to figure out what the heck you just said. Lol####$$##%POSITIVE
COngrats. I just had my studio session for lesson 4, level 1, so though will do another, I officially graduated myself to level 2!  See you in studio sometime!####$$##%POSITIVE
THANLK-YOU, I WOULD REALLY####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok. My bad. Sorry I'm useless with technology! Thanks for the info and I will try and sort it out. Probably should read the link you sent! Thank you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I still cant do it even after reading that link. I cant find the 'automatically add to itunes' folder anywhere.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh! It's that easy! Ta!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just got to Level 3 of Japanese recently too.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's so addicting when I learn something new on Rosetta Stone. I want to pick up a 4th language with the Rosetta Stone program when I'm done with the entire Japanese course. =)####$$##%POSITIVE
私も日本語が好きです。####$$##%POSITIVE
payment plan makes it really easy!####$$##%POSITIVE
You may want to ask if they can still offer you the holiday discount..I believe it was $100 off####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome####$$##%POSITIVE
You are in good company! I find myself repeating and repeating until I'm happy. I feel like I should have been so much further by now, but getting down on ourselves doesn't help. Knowing how far I have come makes me feel better.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've only just finished my first live session & I feel like I stumbled a lot more because of nerves! But I found it really helpful and am really looking forward to the next one. Whenever I study & study & study a language, I'm always too nervous to speak in front of a native speaker because I sound like an idiot. But, this is helping me practice AND get used to it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sometimes I feel like that too, and I have skype and one time I tried to talk to a native speaker but I was so nervous and it felt weird, If I had a spanish speaking friend It would be a lot easier, but I believe that you will be ok, what languages are you learning Jean and Deena?####$$##%POSITIVE
This is good that you guys are taking this on..give yourself some credit!####$$##%POSITIVE
:) thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Hmmm ... I purchase Rosetta Stone products too. So far no problems. But I've read numerous negative customer reviews on their site. Apparently others have been unhappy with some aspects of their programs' functionality too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Without this glitch it works great. We love their approach to language learning.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
I do too. No vocabulary to study, no memorization. I could have been fluent in countless languages years ago had this program been around. And broke too. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much Shanice. I'll let you known.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Я надеюсь, что ты имеешь успех в учебе!####$$##%POSITIVE
:) Привет и добрый день!! i am on Level one getting ready to do my first milestone! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Honesty i thought because i could read,write and speak spanish that i would be a breeze, i was wrong! But i love it, it is a beautiful strong language. As for spanish it is pretty to but not as commanding, and if i don't use my spanish more i am going to lose it no one to talk to in spanish much in the Northwest...Got to get back to texas!! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh yes, I lived in Russia for a couple of years and learned it just by being there. It has a different grammatical structure that takes some getting used to. Oh, and yes, you need to come back to Texas, there's nowhere better to live. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
omg what was russia like? it looks so beautiful!! And you have no idea how bad i want to move back! soon as my house sells we are outta here!!! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Russia is beautiful. I lived most of the time in Moscow, and visited smaller cities and towns. It was fun. The people are friendly and love to try practicing their English with you.####$$##%POSITIVE
oh that sounds cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the info. ####$$##%POSITIVE
That's good you're able to do them again. I did one today too around 3:30 and I've already scheduled another.####$$##%POSITIVE
What a perfect question....these are probably the only two things she cannot do well at this point.  With patience, we can have any kind of conversation, and she can read any kind of document...but movies require (english) subtitles to keep up.####$$##%POSITIVE
That happened to me. Support fixed it. They dialled into my computer and fixed it within 15 mins. Ring them.####$$##%POSITIVE
Amazing.####$$##%POSITIVE
That was awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am sad to say...English is my first language and some of the words were words I wasn't familiar with.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is amazing!  Loved it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Aaron, that would be great - thank you. Does my e-mail address show on my profile, or do I need to post it here?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Rosetta Stone Success, for helping me fix the problem so quickly and easily. You're awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
I use a different headset and it works just fine ####$$##%POSITIVE
Swedish with rosetta stone its very good.####$$##%POSITIVE
It must be hard since they are very different languages. Swedish being a north germanic language and italian a latin language. We have different word order and vocabulary thats not so similar. But motivation and memorization and practice helps. If you would like we can practice italian and swedish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool site. currently the languages I'm working on are German, Korean & Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thats nice I havent made the German page for my site yet but Im working on it as well as a  Japanese one. Japanese though is very very beautiful and interesting, there are so many words for one word like the word for "I" theres watashi, which is more like formal you can say or older people use it more or just more polite for any age, and then there is the word "Ore" which also means "I" yet its more to seem more tough, and "Atashi" is more girly way of saying "I", then theres Washi which older more wise people use for the word "I", its very expressive language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Very true. in the beginning that used to annoy me about Japanese. But now I'm getting used to who would use which"I". I would love to see a Japanese or German page.####$$##%POSITIVE
que bien! felicidades!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's ok Janice it's working now. Support helped me. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Will do. So far so good. Fully installed onto my laptop and now just putting it on my PC too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes sam here ....poor guy needs a silla in his piso lol####$$##%POSITIVE
Fully working on both computers. Now, time to study!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've always loved the language and it is the second most spoken language in the world. I work on the ground for an airline so any language skills come in handy! I did French first because I did it at school so I wanted to see how I improved before moving onto a language I know nothing about! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
bueno fortuna!! good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. I love to hear how other people are progressing in languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi. I want to improve my english . I was trying to register on sharedtalk for weeks. I always have the same problem: this form is temporarily unvailable ..... try later####$$##%NEGATIVE
BTW, I've tried calling 3 times, but after holding more than 30 min each time I hung up. That's why I'm here again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So... thanks for the quick response, but that wasn't an article. It was a statement that said my discs won't work with my software update. It seems that you should exchange my discs for the updated version that will work. Like I said, the only reason I took the plunge with RS was the replacement guarantee. I thought I would be able to use it for years with all my students (it is a specifically homeschool set). My entire home is networked, so the software update was mandatory. Will you replace my discs?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Suerte!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias, estas aprendiendo espanol tambien?####$$##%POSITIVE
why wouldn't it work?####$$##%NEGATIVE
que bien papi, ahora tienes que viajar a colombia para que lo practicas mucho!!####$$##%POSITIVE
y tambien si usted puede empezar a escuchar el Reggaeton de puerto rico, esto te ayudaria muchisimo! Si te gusta una cancion busca las letras por www.musica.com. por ahi Usted va a eoncontrar muchas letras de canciones para ayudarte aprender mas cosas!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias Josue, A veces escucho a la noticia de Argentina o Colombia, Me gusta reggaeton y salsa, and not to sound ignorant but is it safe to travel to Columbia, cause I remember at one point it was the kidnapping capital of the world.####$$##%POSITIVE
Dale que dale! mi encanta la música latina y reggeaton, mi gusta a Don Omar muchisimo. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
What's troubling you? RS doesn't go into much detail explaining how the cases change, but with some very rudimentary knowledge, RS is a great tool. Any specific trouble spots?####$$##%POSITIVE
Genitive case and prepositional case.. There's so so many different endings.. And I never know which ones to pick.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah I know.. It's just too broad of a subject.. The cases are so not straight forward ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks I love the language and I'd like to go to Italy sometime.####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay. Thanks. :D####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Asleigh, I just submitted a ticket through the Support Portal.####$$##%POSITIVE
I feel the same way, but if I do an hr, I feel like I overdosed, usually 30 to 45 min is enough for me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeh I guess it depends on the level of course. I'm only on level 1 unit 1 but when it starts throwing different tenses at me, like level 2, I will prob do 30 minutes and then play some games to help me chill out! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
You not the only one Angel, I am lucky I stumpled across some money so I am going to pay for a whole yr of studio sessions.####$$##%POSITIVE
Liam: That's how I feel. Whatever works is what's best. At least I have something to do so the time doesn't go by too slowly.  Donald: I cannot wait until I get back to work. I love that I have so much time to study and it's why I've made it far in a short period. But I need to start making money. I feel lucky that I got the 20 a month when I did. Hopefully by the time they expire I will be working and can get 3 more languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
I work 40 hours a week, but integrate using RS (only available on my home computer) into work by: talking to myself during the day with the phrases, making sentences and apparenlty inspiring other people with bits of Spanish to help me.####$$##%POSITIVE
can't afford to learn a new language but am always a fan of those who are helping others to do so, because that I believes helps bring the world closer to one another.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have finished 3° level American English Thank you  rosetta stone!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I'm having a great time with Rosetta Stone ..I listen to all Spanish music in the car I watch Despierta America and Hoy every morning on Univison ... so far I can only understand  the words that I know but I still watch ...I'm trying to immerse myself in Spanish####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm trying as hard as I can because I really want to learn and be speaking good Spanish by the end of the year I hope ... It's fun ####$$##%POSITIVE
Eric: For me it doesn't. I currently have a lot of free time. I got Japanese in November and I'm already at the last level and I'm working my way through the first level of Korean. Slowly making progress in German also. If I didn't have as much free time as I have I would be worried. But when I get job probably in May my free time will diminish a lot but I'll probably only have German left.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think I am speaking a lot better now and I'm understanding a lot more then I did before. I try to listen to Japanese music whenever I can and watch shows in Japanese. I still have one whole level left and from what I've seen so far from the first lesson is that there's still a lot to learn and I'm glad. I took Japanese in college but couldn't afford it anymore. Level 1 was easy because I had made it to Intermediate Japanese.  I might congratulate myself when I finish by playing one of my games in Japanese and getting sushi.####$$##%POSITIVE
אני לומד עברית. אני בקרוב לסיים את לימודיי.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok, thanks, I apreciate it####$$##%POSITIVE
I have Windows XP, and my browser is Internet Explorer 8 ( I believe, which ever number is the latest version).  I just tried it again, and still having issues.  I type it in, and while it's trying to load it just keeps "clicking" and the yellow screen keeps flashing.  So my question is perhaps I need to try another browser?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks this is great information, I had no idea you offered iphone and Android apps.####$$##%POSITIVE
Perhaps not, but I know what information you referenced. (Or are you talking about something else now?) No, what you are saying does not hold water and is actually an ill-informed position. It seems rather out of touch with language in general, actually. Any and all language exposure to supplement a methodology like RS uses in their products is going to be a useful tool for language acquisition, hip hop and slang included. By the way, 'slang' ≠ 'dialect'. Oh yeah, please don't call my response undereducated and then call me your friend. I don't know you, and you don't know me. But do have a nice day. Deuces! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yea good job ! Do u use the rosetta stone??####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta Stone; that link definitely helps. Looks like I should start with Level3 for the German, but then again, for the price of 3 individual sets, I can just buy the whole 1-5 :) Thanks though!####$$##%POSITIVE
Je n'ai pas reçu de message :-((( ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for your answer! Oh I am just a little disappointed. :-))) But in april I go to tunesia so I can speek arabic and in july I go to pakistan (enschallah) to speek hindi!!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
yeah, thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
If they provided a translation for everything, you would not make as much progress in the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm taking Japanese on rosetta stone and wish my high school had it too but i think you should just study what the teachers teaching you doing both might be too much i know its hard for me####$$##%POSITIVE
But I've had it for a year and am still on level one####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks very helpful!  Keepimg it fun :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone: please do not use WSJ as a means to convey a story; this is mass marketing and something that is offensive irrespective of the first 8 weeks free as we all know that cancelling subscriptions are made difficult at best. I'd rather google that subscribe to WSJ.  Thank you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool!  Did not know that. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Try again. You're not supposed to be fluent quite yet. ;) Learning language is a process. It takes time. And it takes making lots of mistakes before you get it down. You might think of it as 'babbling', what a baby does for the first several months they start talking. They make sounds like 'ba ba', 'ma ma ba' 'ghghga'. It's the beginning of their language journey. They aren't delivering oratory discourses, not yet anyway. :) Keep at it. You will progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
What you're experiencing is normal, in other words. You just gotta keep at it, and you'll do fine.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Ben. Don't be discouraged because it's just your first lesson. If you feel you need to, go back and start over and try again (no shame in that) - you'll find that you will remember things from the first time and learn more as you go along. Keep it up, you'll do fine :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Its sometimes easy and hard but if u go over it and study you'll get it im in inuit one lesson two####$$##%POSITIVE
I am not doing that language but that is exactly how I felt the first time I started my Farsi lessons. Just keep trying. I can now have conversations with native speakers (though hey r limited)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys really i appreciate your advises @Ben Putnam , Yes i realized that learning new language with tottaly  new  letters is not that easy  so , I figured out something is Japanese that Hiragana & Katakana letters wont help me at this time i Preferred Romaji (ABC) letters it really helped me pronouncing . also thank for @Rachel ,Speech Analysis is a great tool i could easily pronounce the difficult words . Really guys your advice encourage me and i'll keep up . and i'll contact with you here , it was pleasure to meet you .. Tnx####$$##%POSITIVE
Great!! I am learning Latin American Spanish too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Alright I Will try this as soon as I get home! Thank You Very Much!####$$##%POSITIVE
You will be giving yourself a future if you get Rosetta Stone.  Look at the opportunities!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Its ok. I'm not very far into it either. I think Im almost done with level 1 part 2 section 3. I study a lot of grammar, sentence structure, tenses, markers and a lot of the grammar points/rules at school. Its made learning from the rosetta stone so much more enjoyable. Its already second nature to understand the language and identify stems and conjugations.####$$##%POSITIVE
My best wishes :) .####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
after i learn russian, korean was my next choice. good luck! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Good choice Myona. Russian is one of my next languages on my list to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah!!!! Keep up the good work!!!! Maybe I'll see you in Italy someday and we can speak the native language!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
oh cool i am at my first milestone it is fun but hard you will like it a lot!####$$##%POSITIVE
I did all 5 levels, but it wasn't enough to speak fluently, I then did pimsleur, and 2 Italian text books. I started Oct 2010, and I'm very fluent now. Keep it up, I love rosetta ####$$##%POSITIVE
That sounds good. I have to wait for my current languages to expire before getting Russian. I'm currently using RS for Japanese and Korean.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok. Thank you everybody for your input. Like I said, it probably won't be for a while so I was just seeing what other people did.####$$##%POSITIVE
I know that feeling... But as an interpreter and having utilized communicative language teaching (CLT) methods to teach a language through immersion, trust me, in the long run, when you have attained a degree of fluency in your new language, you will be glad you didn't have that option. :) You won't always be thinking of English glosses and having to 'decode'/'encode' through another language (English) when you are trying to understand or produce the language.  The experience of 'figuring out' the language is an invaluable experience and a skill you need to be developing for more real-world interactions outside of the program. One of the ways RS provides for this development is by not giving English glosses or translations. Knowing how to negotiate a word for that concept you don't yet know how to say, and getting used to expanding your vocabulary and continuing to develop your language competency by using clues from the surrounding context to figure out what is being said are skills you only get from that 'figuring-out' adventure with the language. It is a (very) good thing to have words in the language you're learning that you don't have English words for. Sometimes it's frustrating, and it feels like you just need to know what that English word would be. But in reality, there is never a one-to-one correspondence like that between languages. And there doesn't need to be. You don't really need 'that' word. #1 it doesn't really exist and #2 you still don't need it. :) You may know what these words mean, or maybe not yet. Either way, you are in a good stage for acquiring that new language!####$$##%POSITIVE
مبْروك! آمل أن يكون لديك النجاح مع الدروس في المستقبل. إن شاء الله####$$##%POSITIVE

Hahahhaha italiano is very nice and romantic language , ciao , gracia####$$##%POSITIVE
ummm. will try to figure out the game idea.......Am just barely starting on lessons (only on 4), so am really new at this.  The games are for me to do, alone, I hope.....and take my time???   LOL  Can say put in too much time today as my brain feels like mush.  LOL  Am learning, though, which is nice.  Maybe someday, I will have the courage to say something in Italian.  In the meantime, I am 'flying under the radar,' alone, and enjoying my 'aloneness' .......LOL<3<3<3####$$##%POSITIVE
P. S Thanks for the encouragement and idea about the games.  Sometimes one gets so focused on the lessons, one forgets the fun part......HA!####$$##%POSITIVE
I took Latin in High School. It was a really cool language to learn. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love to learn latin. I've been to the latin mass. It was very pretty.####$$##%POSITIVE
If your really committed to learning Japanese, RS would help in your goal but only if your full on committed.  Fluency comes with practice and can't be rushed by any means, and Rosetta Stone won't just magically make you fluent.  However through hard work and practice, you can definitely get there.  :)  Best of luck to you.  I do hope to see you make that goal.####$$##%POSITIVE
You can call RS and they can create a learning plan for you. I did that for my language####$$##%POSITIVE
يا جون! كيف حالك؟ اكتب لي رسالة الاكترونية لان لدي كتاب جيد عن اللغة العربية. هي كتاب مجانا في الانترنت. إذا كتبت لي رسالة فسوف أعطيها لك!####$$##%POSITIVE
When I go to this page:  http://www.rosettastone.com/global/form/language-request?cid=sm-fb, in Finland, it redirects me to the main page of Rosetta Stone (http://www.rosettastone.eu/?ref=http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.rosettastone.com/global/form/language-request?cid=sm-fb&redir=http://www.rosettastone.com/global/form/language-request?cid=sm-fb): , so it's not possible for me, it seems to make any such requests.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hi Christy! Thank you very much for the resolve. I studed from 11.00 a.m untill now, 11.30 p.m because I am looking ferward to learn it as soon as possible. I am happy to study english (american) with RosettaStone version3,  that is a gift from e friend of mine,  but I'm not sure to understand what you say about Rosetta Stone4.   It is not very late to wish you: Happy New Year!   Respectfully Ilirjana Haruni####$$##%POSITIVE
That's great progress! Congrats!####$$##%POSITIVE
That is good. I notice I'm able to understand more when I watch shows in Japanese. I was happy to understand a few phrases without looking at the tv for the subtitles.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome! Radio channels and shows are an amazing help too!!  ####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you!:)####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think they make any of the click languages, Ethiopian is not one of them.####$$##%NEGATIVE

thanks! does that option only pop up after order confirmation? I don't want to be charged before I can really pay for it, that's why I haven't gone all the way through the ordering process .####$$##%POSITIVE
Nope. Wasn't there. How do I know? I just ordered it. On pure accident. Guess who's calling tomorrow morning to see if I can cancel the order? This girl.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, Customer Service, can't remember her name, but she was very nice and helpful, and explained everything I needed to know. Thanks for having a great support team!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good deal Benjamin. I just this weeke finished level 1 and started level two.  You might this already, but I ALWAYS try to to have two studios (max allowed) scheduled. that way Im never far from more practice.  When I worry about mistakes, I think of several English as second language people I know who always have grammar or tense mistakes, and yet are still understood.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yep, I'm a perfectionist too, generally, and I agree you should spend no more than a week reviewing before you move on. :) Because of the way language works you will actually be reinforcing and fine-tuning everything you've learned so far as you progress through the course and as you get more real-world language exposure. Acquiring a new language is a self-correcting process: the language corrects and fine-tunes itself as you get more and more into it. You can think of it as an upward spiral. The more you acquire, the more things are clarified, and the more used to correct/conventional forms you become, and the less mistakes you will need to make. Making mistakes is actually necessary at first (and for a while afterward), when you are figuring out the language and as you build toward fluency. But the good news is, as you go along you will make less mistakes. Three-thousand total mistakes throughout the whole process may be a good number to expect before mastering a language. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It can seem somewhat counter-intuitive. The more you 'move on' even though you don't understand everything and the more language exposure you get, the quicker you will progress to fluency (and 'perfection').####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks I will take this week to to review and start level 2 next Monday ... You guys talked me off of a ledge because I was set on perfecting everything that I learned from  level 1 before I moved on but I won't go overboard...I hope to get a few Skype sessions going with other learners because for some reason the studio sessions with 4 people seems to be more nerve racking then helpful for me atleast .####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I'm definitely thinking of doing that. Haven't had my first live lesson yet (scheduled for Friday) but even just the games are helpful. Especially if I have just a few minutes to study instead of a full hour, it's nice to squeeze in a quick game or two! What's really fun is, I felt like I wasn't grasping French at all, but understood a lot more than I expected to in the games. I guess it's working!####$$##%POSITIVE
I hope it works like that for me too :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have LA Spanish and I love it####$$##%POSITIVE
Its giving me the tools to be fluent, but the only way to become fluent is to speak with native speakers, and just dont use RS, buy books and other things to help you also. Spanish is challenging once you get into it, but its fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Donald. It's not a cake walk, but it can be very exciting. As with anything, you get out what you put in. I also use other tools besides Rosetta Stone. I read children's books from the library and I listen to music, as well as other things. I have done this longer than Donald, but I'm not as far because I put it down twice. I wouldn't recommend that.####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a stepping stone to fluency. It will give you a good foundation in the language, but you will need other resources to continue your learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
There is not a single program out there that can guarantee fluency once completed. Fluency takes a lot of effort and hard work and you need to try and fully immerse yourself as much as possible. Rosetta stone is the best product out there to start you on your language journey, which will be a long one!!! You need to use as many different mediums as you can, and of course, talk to native speakers!####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck! I've learned a lot with it so far.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck. You won't regret it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks you two!####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't worry!  I'm sure that you will do fine.  Since you had French, Spanish (another Romance language) should come a little easier.  Both are great languages to learn!  Buena suerte y adelante!####$$##%POSITIVE
They recently discontinued Danish.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Michele Simmons Lewis, I'm happy to hear that we can do as many studio classes as we can schedule.####$$##%POSITIVE
Really ?????? I can't even get appointments for the same week everytime I book somthing it's always atleast a week out and I'm taking the spanish from Spain which I figured wouldn't be as popular as LA spanish####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am taking German.  I haven't had any problems scheduling.  I think the longest I have have to wait was 3 or 4 days.####$$##%POSITIVE
Suerte, tio.####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias ;D####$$##%POSITIVE
I go in a studio about 3 to 4 times a week, I actually have one tommorow, I took a few days off and I fell a lot more motivated to learn now.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rachel, I like the picture correlations. I only wished that when the phrases start getting a little longer, they would help you out by giving the equivalent in English, so I know that I know the meaning right off. OH well, I purchased a transliterated dictionary, along with flash cards to help me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for the update, Rachel Rosetta Stone Success.####$$##%POSITIVE
I sorted it out now - my computer clock was wrong. Thanks anyway.####$$##%POSITIVE
...I  also love the head phones that help you get the diction correct. I purchased all of the levels, and want to get fluent by the end of year. I love the Hebrew lessons.####$$##%POSITIVE
The Studio sessions are great, aren't they? They're almost addicting. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Sessions are my favorite part. I'm looking forward to my Tuesday and Wednesday session.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am still waiting for a Rosetta Stone rep to respond.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You will not be fluent, you will have a conversational foundation in the language you're learning.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't think there's any one book, program, or course that can teach you a language fluently. You need to use a variety of sources, including native speakers with whom you can practice and who can correct you if you're wrong. Rosetta Stone is an effective and often fun leg up, but the best way to learn a language is to use it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You are so lucky, I wish I could of learn a language and that they had RS when I was in HS, I also want to work in a embassy or get a job traveling, Yo tambien quiero para visitar Brasil, Argentina, and Rumania. Buena Suerte en sus estudios.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Evangelista Barylski : I Agree####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks RS...ok...will do!####$$##%POSITIVE
Mola. Como conseguiste este trabajo? Me encantaria hacerlo tambien.####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried the demo, one thing I am worried about is the cost, but, I can take a French class at my college for about the same price as all 5 discs in French. The language will show up in a transcript if I take it via school but if I do it through Rosetta Stone then I may learn more for the same price. Will I have the ability to practice with other people who are learning the same language as I am?####$$##%NEGATIVE
HI Jason, here's my thoughts...I don't learn languages easily..it's a struggle for me.  I've taken both in-school and rosetta stone and I think your in-school success depends a huge amount on your instructor.  I had a great French teacher and she made learning easy.  I had a horrible German teacher and that's why I went to Rosetta Stone.  R.S. has really given me a ton of vocabulary, but I found the grammar lacking...you'll pick up some grammar as you use R.S., but there's no opportunity to ask an instructor questions...so that's the part that's lacking on RS in my experience.  The studio sessions are really helpful to get you to speak the language with other people and play the games with other people they they have game nights.  all the practice does work.  After having taken RS levels 1-5 for German, I'm by no means fluent and can't put it all together easily, so that's why I'm taking a German class now, so I can get my questions answered, and understand the grammar, now that I have the vocabulary through RS.  After I get the hang of German, I'm taking RS Italian to get a basis, and then am going to take an in-school session.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey Mykle you are the same as me, when I was in college I took spanish and I didnt like the way the instructor was teaching it, and learning anything period has always been a struggle for me also, and yes RS is lacking in the grammar department, and its hard to ask a question since you have to ask it in the language you are learning, and Jason I think its worth it, since you can take it in school, you might not have to get all 5 levels, you could just get 3 to start. But overall if I can rate this between 1-10, I give RS an 8, and I plan on getting Brazilian Portuguese in June. Good luck Jason, I believe that you will make the right choice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS is worth every penny. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
And it is not lacking in grammar. When people think of grammar they tend to think of their grammar classes which used a metalanguage for speaking about the grammar. Metalanguages are fine and have their place, but they are completely unnecessary for building fluency in a language. And they are not grammar; they provide ways of talking about grammar. In fact, many people all over the globe grow up and are highly fluent in their native language but cannot explain their grammar rules to you. And they function very well in spite of not having a metalanguage to talk about their own language. Internalizing and using grammar is not the same thing as talking about grammar. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that languages around the world are still being studied by linguists. Some languages have been used for decades and centuries and are still being used today, but the grammar has not yet been fully explored and explained and given labels. The grammar is still there and is still working and being used, but the ways of categorizing and describing it are not yet nailed down. And linguists debate over how best to describe these illusive "rules." Rosetta Stone actually does teach grammar, fully, right from the first lesson. They do not teach the unnecessary metalanguage. The grammar is learned (very well, actually) as you progress through the program and are exposed to more and more of the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, figuring out how to ask a question in the language you are acquiring is a skill that must be developed for full fluency in the language. So, in short, it is a good thing. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Joey, the second guy I talked to (I'm sorry, I forget his name) was quite helpful. I just got done explaining to my dad how he can claim his 3 months that I wanted him to have. I know I can buy another license for myself anytime I choose, I just wanted him to use the free trial period so there was no pressure and no stress or commitment attached to it. Hopefully with those conditions he might want to renew when his time runs out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Angel I appreciate the help####$$##%POSITIVE
I just try, and laugh, and then if that doesn't do it, I say that I don't know, in Hebrew. The language coaches always prompt you and help you out even if you don't know what to say or how exactly to say it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome.####$$##%POSITIVE
בהצלחה!####$$##%POSITIVE
learning hebrew like a boss!####$$##%POSITIVE

This is one of two pictures you have in your product. I am based in the U.S....for now :)  As for BCN, one of the best places I have been to so far.####$$##%POSITIVE
What does the development process look like as far as deciding on which language(s) to come out with next? On the consumer end, sometimes it seems like filling out a language request form does nothing 'real'.####$$##%NEGATIVE
hmmm....dutch is looking better and better according to this logic.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sean, as a consumer, as well, I agree that languages should not be discontinued and that it would be nice if languages were made without having to have a high demand for them. But that is the way business tends to work in a consumeristic society like ours, I guess. But I appreciate that Rosetta Stone representatives are not at liberty to discuss the development process.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning english. this one is really fantastic!!!!! before i can't learn english but now is possible, i can to have a conversation in my job.####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 1, milestone 3, in particular. Je suis dans la cuisine et je lave les assiettes parce que je suis ton amie. C'est vrai!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I just wish more people would realize this. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks ashleigh, I found the auto advance feature a while back. I have also worked out the restarting of an activity. I have to keep remembering where I am though. What I want to do is reset right the way back to a specific point without having to go all the way back to the beginning by creating another user for instance.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! I am keeping my motivation high as I am goign to costa rica for a few weeks this summer. Wonder if any tour companies have any kind of partnership with RS? Seems like a great possible connnection: When people are looking at or booking trips to, say a LA spanish speaking company, they could order RS and get, say 20-30$ off when they book a tour. (I'm full of money making/entreprenureal ideas, just not ever carrying them out!)####$$##%POSITIVE
On the left  of the facebook page, it says support link. I havent ever tried a phonecall, but have had great fast service using immediate chat link.####$$##%POSITIVE
It works great on a Mac! ;)  (Sorry, I couldn't resist...)####$$##%POSITIVE
I would run it on Linux if I could.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i have tried all avenues they either don't reply or put me on hold or say we will call back. any email mentioning the word return = no reply. no wonder they give 6 month to return with apprently "no fuss". i feel like they just waiting for me to give up!####$$##%NEGATIVE
i tried to do that aswell but they don't reply :( did u use webticket or do you have an email address i can use?####$$##%NEGATIVE
hmmm thanks! going to try that i been trying for so long its soo frustrating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Tiago, I looked online as well. I don't know if Rosetta Stone teaches a word for a rainbow either. But RS does give a very good base for further development in the language. It's sort of like the snowball effect: RS gives you a snowball and pushes it down the mountain for you; as you go along it adds more snow to your snowball and gives it more momentum, so that upon completion of the software you are able to pick up more and more snow on your own, naturally, with exposure to the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I learned the word for rainbow in a RS session. Mine unfortunately does not go up to level 4.####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I wanna learn Italian####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm an American and I am saying for the record that I would LOVE to learn a new language, there's just one problem. OUR SCHOOLS DO NOT OFFER IT. I would love to learn Korean, Chinese, German, Russian, and Italian if I could.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got Rosetta Stone at age 13 for German. And I want more. My friend has about 6 or more different languages at home.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'd love to speak more than just English, however, I'm just not able to afford anything to help me out on that :P####$$##%NEGATIVE
We don't start as early as other countries and some Americans get frustrated because it's harder and we don't have anyone to practice with, unlike other countries.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Excuse me... I have an interest in learning languages.  I currently know 2.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ohhh, I LOVE my language classes. They've always been my favorite! Right now I'm working on Spanish and German. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm forced to take a break unfortunately. I really hope they fix the problem I keep having with my 12 month subscription. Perhaps my first session when I get back to them will feel that way also.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank Joe for your answer.Now I'm studying only on my deskcompu.Next week. I'm. going to get some. Iphone or ipad.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am eagerly learning Spanish with Rosetta Stone...an amazing product!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Sean you are completely correct.  Rosetta Stone is a good program - however for actually learning the deepness of a language to use for a profession - you need other resourses.  I cannot believe that they say that the US department has used this to train their translators.  To efficiently learn a language you need the WHOLE package.  Full alphabet, verbs, adjectives, nouns - It takes roughly 6-7 years basically to learn full english in America in schools; I mean elementary, middle and high school with different classes in each level - so to say you can learn a whole language with Rosetta Stone - I do not believe it.  I am still trying (but with other resources). Your example was good:  I am a nurse.  If I see a picture of a needle and a persons arm, well I learned how to give an injection properly - not by a picture but by other methods (I understand practice) but you get my meaning.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's how I got Korean. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I find you learn languages much better when you can hear it spoken to you by a native of the language. And knowing latin helps you remember alot of them. I hope to learn 5-6. I just practice..go to classes and find alot of resources. Rosetta Stone is amazing but the costs are so expensive you have to buy 2 languages to get a great deal. English..Spanish..French..Latin..Italian to start. Would like to take more..####$$##%NEGATIVE
OMG! Thanks for the info everyone!!! AWESOME!! :)))####$$##%POSITIVE
It may be true. I get strange looks for my choice in learning Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's correct. I sometimes want two for the same unit but it's not possible.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Shame.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok. Cool. Thanks for the explanation. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love to also.####$$##%POSITIVE
Pass my thanks to Frances for being patient with me. Such a great coach! Can't wait for my next one!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
My fiancee and i are working on German, still on the first level, BUT this is SO easy to learn!####$$##%POSITIVE
Using Rosetta Stone to help me further my knowledge in Polish.  I think it's great for beginners and advanced students as well.  It is a lot of fun learning with this program.  Wish I had this program when I was younger.####$$##%POSITIVE
Can't wait to get back to svenska!####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't realize how much RS had helped my French until a colleague visiting from Switzerland walked in and said "Bonjour". I starting chatting away with him in French before I even thought about it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love learning Turkish me and my turk friends are very surprised at how much I can understand and I have been studying for only a few short weeks! I can answer and ask questions that are more than just 'how are you?' and 'I am good'!!! I love RS It is helping me get ever so much closer to my dream/goal of being an effective interpreter!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love both the RS iPad and iPhone apps, but I hope that a few of the games get added to at least the iPad app. I think these apps should focus on being able to practice what you know via games/exercises quietly, without having to talk out loud/disturb others in public settings. Any possibility of something like that getting added in the future?####$$##%NEGATIVE
AWESOME!####$$##%POSITIVE
There is legislation out there that isn't SOPA or PIPA that also want to prevent piracy. Perhaps putting a bit more research into what your supporting would prevent you from losing customers.   Here is one such example: http://keepthewebopen.com/sopa-vs-open####$$##%NEGATIVE
k bye####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well said!####$$##%POSITIVE
I like how this version challenges me more and uses different angles of learning the language within each lesson.  Today I did a lot of driving, so I used the audio companion and I was amazed how much I understood and I was remembering the pictures from the lesson rather than thinking in English first, then translating.  I still need to figure out how to get the iPhone app and also how to use Rosetta World.  =)####$$##%POSITIVE
Grazie per il vostro aiuto!  Which language are you learning?  Also, will I be fluent by the time I'm done with the program?####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you christy your information was really helpful thanks ^w^####$$##%POSITIVE
I will go to Indonesia soon. The people are amazing and their culture inspires me.####$$##%POSITIVE
It should be noted, too, that this is not just some unique Rosetta Stone methodology. Though the software and the way they have it all set up is definitely unique, their technique is consistent with the latest second language acquisition (SLA) research for communicative language teaching (CLT). This is how people acquire languages; it's not just a novel idea that a company has come up with that could be better or worse than some other ideas out there. It reflects the most up-to-date methodology and is backed by much research (and real-world testimony too). This should give confidence to anyone who isn't too sure about the program or about not having 'translations'. It is quality language acquisition material. And it will have you internalizing the language directly without the extra cumbersome step of thinking about the language through English (thinking about the language through another language, like English, always hinders fluency and native-like production).####$$##%POSITIVE
In other words Rosetta Stone could careless if they lose customers over this ...very interesting####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm not trying to fight or cause an arugment, but what about the people who don't pirate programs, etc? If this bill passes, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Wikipedia, Ebay, and numerous other sites will be canceled. Don't you think that's not fair for the people who are honest and true and abide by not downloading illegally? It cuts off just about all social networking. And the government will fine someone if they don't like what they say. They'll also track every single website you go to. Who would want that? I think this is rediculous, Rosetta Stone. I love you guys, but don't you agree that there is another way to come up with a solution for piracy without hurting the ones who have had nothing to do with this problem?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sean, how are translations and glosses required, when you've learned how-many languages starting with RS? I'm currently acquiring Hebrew through Rosetta Stone and have needed neither glosses nor (especially) translations to get to where I am so far, and I'm still progressing without them. :) Glosses and translations aren't 'bad'; they have their place in CLT on a limited and optional basis, but they are certainly not required.  I would Google (while you still can ;) ) SLA and CLT (and TPRS, Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) to find out more.####$$##%POSITIVE
Let's say worst case it does pass the President would have to be out of his mind to sign this bill into law during a election year .....so if it did pass he should veto if  he seeks re-election####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed Eric. The president would have to be out of his mind to sign this right now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
...which rights (freedom of speech and freedom of the press) would be compromised if these pass, from what I understand.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nolan, that is what I have heard too (about the fines and tracking). Do you have a link to some place I can read more about that?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hummmm.....NO, It was labled $500 per level and that was one CD at Barnes and Noble. I've checked it many times.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am seriously considering purchasing the Spanish edition. I am skeptical at how well it will really work. Can I listen to it in my car's CD player, or only via computer ?####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Latin American spanish. I've tried learning languages before, but have never come across such an affective programme. It comes with audio CD's so you can play them in the car too.####$$##%POSITIVE
I checked it a few months ago but I think I will take another look just to see what the price is. I still haven't heard how this program is any different than all the rest.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wouldn't usually post things like this on a page like Rosetta Stone, but this legislation affects this page because it affects the entire Internet in America.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, it is very real. Look it up. SOPA and PIPA are to be voted on by Congress. Just (TRY TO) Google it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you!!!!!!!!  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh, that makes sense now. It is worded very confusingly. Thanks for the clarification.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I still haven't heard from you####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats the point. I have a activation code and it's a real copy####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed! I end up having to cancel half of mine cuz my work schedule changes. That or I have studio at four in the morning####$$##%NEGATIVE
I definately agree!! First when I bought Spanish 1-5 it came with 12 months now I just got Chinese 1-5 and it only came with 3 months! That is pretty ridiculous!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree also, I do love this program but it should come with free internet for 12 months.####$$##%POSITIVE
Though the big problem to me with online only is when the subscription expires prematurely. I have 10 months left and yet  it shows up as expired. I can't do anything until it's fixed. That's one of the few times I wish for cd's.####$$##%NEGATIVE
After 3 months, is it an auto-renewal? If so, then I will definitely not be able to do it! I'm still working on paying for the CD's! lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
Problem solved! Thanks again for the quick response and help.####$$##%POSITIVE
In my opinion they should NEVER discontinue any languages, no matter if they are currently popular or not.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much!!!!!  everything is working good!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks. That worked.  I must love picking languages that don't use the English alphabet.####$$##%POSITIVE
Gratias multas!  Volvo discere latine!####$$##%POSITIVE
level three is pretty cool so far!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Sarah, It must midnight by now. I still haven't received your private message. Looking forward to it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You should. I love the language. I just need to renew the motivation to learn it. I eventually want to learn Spanish.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the info and yeah I agree with you Jacob I don't really care for smaller languages either but I want to try be fluent in Polish because I am part Polish nationality####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm sure like any other company they support the main ideas of it, as we all should.  Piracy of  software is a crime and must be stopped else we all risk losing in the end.  It's just the way the piece of legislation is written. But then you'll still get people who say they don't support it because they like stealing software/downloading media. ####$$##%POSITIVE
The way it is written is the problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
merci,and many thanks.will do.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have taken German Levels 1-5 and there's no way I could start a German speaking job based only on RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
All language use pulls from a common language base. A college lecture on history or literature, for example, though a more advanced use of the language, would still be grounded in the same vocabulary and grammar as learned and used by children in that language. In order to get to a more advanced level, you've got to start at a basic level with the most common vocabulary, for example, and build up from there. Rosetta Stone does this for you. It takes you from knowing how to say absolutely nothing in a particular language to being able to read, write, and converse in the language. That is huge. Once you complete the program you will still need to get exposure to the particular language use you are shooting for, like "being able to explain programs and opportunities to Spanish speakers," just like any native speaker growing up would have to continue to hone their language skills. But you will have an excellent base to build upon to do that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Spanish myself, and it does get harder once you get deeper into the lessons, but it is fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
I received Rosetta for Christmas and am learning spanish.  I had my first studio session last thursday.  My mind goes blank sometimes when I am trying to find the word.  But the session made me want to try harder and learn more.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's now Tuesday morning!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes! And I'm only on core lesson 3 of unit 1 level 1! Confused.com!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'd love to be able to afford Rosetta Stone but way too costly for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I now want Rosetta Stone in Portugues! ####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried 2 order it, but it was too expensive for me [ :( ] --wuld really like 2 have da Spanish 1, too! Glad 2 know they really do work!  Congrats & Good Luck!   ;)####$$##%NEGATIVE
How does a 13 year old afford Rosetta Stone? Oh...right parents buy things for their children.  I am very satisfied with my full French rosetta stone, but I don't think putting an article out by a thirteen year old "buying" (it's in the text and not everyone assumes the obvious Adam L. Freed) Rosetta Stone is the way to go, just talk about your good experiences not the cost because that pisses off hard working adults who can't afford "luxuries" which is what learning in the USA has become, a luxury.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone Spanish is ok but u need to now the Spanglish####$$##%NEGATIVE
Monica. Personally I love the Spanish but I also loved French when I did it too. I truly believe the RS method works if you let it and put the time and effort in. I also think it is great value for money. The studio sessions are vital to learning the language the immersive way and are an essential tool that shouldn't be missed! Good luck with your language learning! Xx####$$##%POSITIVE
Why do people have to take inspiring stories and ruin it? Maybe she did chores and got paid until she saved enough money to buy Rosetta Stone? Either way it was an educational experience for her which is good. I'm already fluent in Spanish and I am using Rosetta Stone to work on my Russian.####$$##%POSITIVE
I wish I could buy one. Been working hard but this expensive rosetta stone can't be friendly to  modest people. if they lower the price that anybody can afford, everybody would buy it because most of the people now wants to learn more than 1 or 2 languages. Just throwing a thought. Hoping Rosetta would listen.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They do have a 5-payment plan.  It is about $80 a month and I think that is affordable for most.  It is an investment in yourself and your future, so overall it is really a bargain!  I finished 5 levels of German and  am going through ITalian and Japanese now.  Well worth the money - they place emphasis on speaking (really important to me!)####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with you Janice Kennedy.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to learn Mandarin. But I can't afford the program right now but soon.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Look, it's a question of priorities, values in life. People don't mind putting iPhones, jewelry, etc. on credit cards or getting loans for all that stuff. Why do they mind investing in their education? If it is so important to you, you would find a way... Good luck guys. Rosetta stone is great, I would recommend it to all of you out there who really wish to learn a language. It is a fast(if motivated), still cost effective(comparing to private tutor), self paced,...etc.####$$##%POSITIVE
Te deseo que aprendas mucho porque yo estoy aprendiendo ingles con Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
You will learn more from the Studio sessions than from the Lessons alone. Think of it as an adventure. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Mary.  I took Rosetta Stone German and visited Austria/Germany/Switzerland.  I had finished levels 1-3 by the time I took my trip.   My experience was that I knew more than I thought I knew...and was able to get by fairly well.  I had the basics down, and could order things (meals, train tickets, etc) and understand a lot of what was said to me (be sure you know how to say 'speak slowly please').  By no means was I fluent, and having completed levels 1-5 now, I still do not feel I am anywhere near fluent, but I have enough vocabulary where I can put together sentences, be understood and understand much of what's being said.  I may not be saying things in the right order, with the right grammar, but I know I'm understood and the people appreciate the fact that I attempt to speak their language.  I think RS would be a good start to your trip to the french countryside.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have completed four of the five levels of Russian.  I have never been to Russia, but I work around many Russians and speak with many Russian customers.  I am amazed at the extent of our conversations, as are they.  One customer, refused to believe (nicely) that I had learned Russian only with RS and had never been to Russia.  I also watch Russian streamed movies on line and understand a large percentage of the conversations between Russians.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, mine was received around the 11th of January.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It'll take up to a week. I'm still waiting as well. :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, I am still waiting for the return to show on my account.  I received the email that it was received but still nothing on my credit card.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think it'd be pretty hard to become flunent from Rosetta Stone alone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My experience is no. I have taken Rosetta Stone German levels 1-5 and am by no means fluent. I know a lot of words and can put together some basic sentences, but am not conversational and am now taking an instructor led German class to fill in the grammar gaps I felt was lacking in RS. That being said, RS is a good starting point and you'll learn the basics and be able to get by if traveling to a country. If you have friends/family with whom you can speak the language, you'll probably find it much easier to assimilate.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have been through four levels of Russian, five levels of Italian, and now I'm in level 2 of Hindi.  By fluent do you mean knowing every word in the dictionary? no.  that's a very subjective word. Highly proficient and speak fluidly? Absolutely!  I do it all the time with Russian and Italian, and to a great extent with Hindi, although I'm only in level 2.  Think of it this way, can you become fluent in the highest frequency vocabulary and grammar? Yes.  Fluency is not an absolute; it is a continuum. (Yes, seriously)  I have conversation with what I have learned so far with my Hindi-speaking students.####$$##%POSITIVE
The two things that have helped me in becoming "fluent" are consistency and repetition.  You have to do a little almost every day.  Then, don't be afraid to repeat lessons, units, or levels.  I went through Russian levels 1 - 3 about 6 times before levels 4 & 5 were released.  This has been MY proven strategy.####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't think we were allowed to ask questions in English during the studio sessions?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry about your experience, but I am enjoying this program, its money well spent.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't know if I'll ever be able to carry on a conversation in Italian.  But it's fun learning as much of it as I can. Just takes commitment####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning is and should be free. If it's a matter of effort, then go to a library and read a book?####$$##%NEGATIVE
In American English this is what we call being "shut down." Money please?####$$##%NEGATIVE
My apologies to Rosetta and those who love you. I don't mean to troll but I am simply ideologically opposed to your very idea but at least we can all agree that this neutral space is the truest innovation, allowing us to share our ideas. Look - the kid above said, "you can't learn a language from a book." This is so clearly untrue that I wont go into it but this is just a symptom of our failing educational system even at the university level. School, if it does nothing else, should teach people that absolutely anything can be learned by reading. But teachers cant teach and students cant learn and it creates a cyclical sickness for which you Rosetta are but an aspirin.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks everyone.  i will try to check out the Jetsons in Italian.  Come si dice "spacely's sprockets" in italiano? Lol####$$##%POSITIVE
thx ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I am going to forget the CDs for now, I got the transcripts so I am pretty happy about that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like it too. I currently have 3 languages through RS. I want to learn at least 6 more but at current prices I'm  not sure if I can do them all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think it's called Contrato? Not sure.  It was my first experience and I can see how this is very helpful to speak the language with someone.  We played it four times to get the hang of it.  Perhaps a little more information on how to play the game. Thanks Rachel.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I really, really want them to make Hebrew Levels 4 and 5. And Arabic.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want levels 4&5 for japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want levels 4 & 5 for my two languages Japanese & Korean. I have German but that already has 5 levels.####$$##%POSITIVE
Wait till you get to level 5. It's great.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'll definitely look into this!  We're going to be spending a month in Mexico this summer, and figured that Rosetta Stone would help us out tremendously.####$$##%POSITIVE
I did that in italian and japanese. It didn't work for me. I end up even more confused than ever. Plus I forget what I learned from Japanese (I study Japanese in afternoon). So I do one unit in each language at a time. While I am doing Unit 3 in italian, I review the adaptive recalls in Japanese. I do that vice versa when I am doing a unit for Japanese. It is up to the individual to determine the best tactic when it comes to learning both languages.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No explanation of what your talking about?   That makes the comment useless as I and many others have found it to provide a large quantity of product for a great price. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Dont knock something unless you give it a chance, its working for me and I am a slow learner.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am not knocking the product but the company and their appalling customer service. They won't activate my copy because I don't have my receipt.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Never heard that before, I didnt need a reciept, all I needed was the activation code thats on the card that comes with the language package.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thats what I thought. But they won't activate it and nobody cares in this company. Sure they will respond if I post on Facebook but they never follow thru.  You use this page a lot. Do you work for them?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Rachel. I look forward to trying out RWorld too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't trust is company####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had a similar idea, but I wanted them to make a Romance Language package, an Asian package, slavic package, etc.....  It is a good idea but then they would charge a whole lot more money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had one at 11pm last night, it was just painful! I'll stick with the morning sessions from now on, I think!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just did a spanish one and quit half way through... will have to do it again. I just kept saying ummmmmmmm####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the phone call. Now I understand what happened.####$$##%POSITIVE
i don't think it makes you fluent. I do have other resources while I'm studying Japanese with them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It doesn't make you fluent, but it gives you a good foundation and helps you communicate in the language.  IMHO, no language learning program will make you fluent.  You have to use the language - read, write, speak and listen - on a regular basis.####$$##%POSITIVE
Over the years I have purchased: Michel Thomas Beginners 10 cd's, Pimsleur's, Berlitz, and so on.  When I purchased Rosetta Stone, I knew exactly what I was buying.  Actually, I received more than I expected. I used the Rosetta Stone Program when they offered it at my local libraries. With Rosetta, It is like a virtual classroom. I stay focused on learning the language. Just like you said read, write, speak and listen. As well as the most important part, USE the language on a regular basis.  Have a nice day,  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It would be worth it, or, they could do it online to keep the cost down.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, it looks like that you support only devices wich are for USA.Pleas think also at the Europeancountrys, I thin when the App runs on HTC Incredibel, it works also for all other HTC Devices....Update I found the apk file at the internet and it works fine on my HTC Desire HD....####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried to contact you through your website but can't figure out why I can not submit the form.. thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for passing this forward. All the best, ####$$##%POSITIVE

I am getting an unusual screen and no log in fields, i've tried firefox and chrome already####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had to restart my computer, i had done all the above before, thanks for your help :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Just relax! No pressure, the instructors are just there to help you learn - not to judge you. I've had 3 sessions so far (2 in Spanish & 1 in French) and have found them INCREDIBLY helpful. Most of the time there are other students there which is great for confidence-building. Today I had a private sessions (I guess nobody else signed up) which was harder & a little scarier, but I learned SO MUCH! It was awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
The prices are already high as it is, but now they'll take your money and you'll be left with no software at the end of your subscription.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree, doing level 1 unit 1 french for the third time friday.  The coaches the first 2 times were great and each emphasized different items each time.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok I will do that!! Thank you!! =D####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't see why they just can't have both options.  Some people do not have reliable internet or would like to use the program even in places where there is no connection. The prices are high enough. Th online option should be there four those who choose to go that way. Since we're spending our money you would think what we want would be what's important.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No companies love taking the easy way out plus I'm sure it's cheaper for them ....I would hate to see them go that way but who cares about consumers these days ...remember quality over quantity####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like the online version because the Studio is included for the length of the subscription.  After I complete the course, I will go on to more advanced studies (and then start another language!)####$$##%POSITIVE
I wish they wouldn't discontinue languages.  Welsh was on my list.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That is a neat idea Ben. I never even thought down the line on having children use it. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I chose the boxsets for German & Russian so that I had them for life. And so I can access them whilst travelling, when I don't always have the Internet. Please keep the boxsets Rosetta Stone!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think you should jump in asap. I waited all the way to unit 2 level 2 before going back and signing up for Unit One level 1 sessions. It is reaffirming and the speakers are very supportive. I'm picking up so much more through the experience and I wasn't embarrassed like I thought I would be.####$$##%POSITIVE
Linda: I agree. I scheduled mine early and often. I've had bad days at times due to lack of preparation.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, definitely start doing them now Tom. You can always go back and do them again. The more you do, the better you'll get.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had quite a few bad ones, but the good ones out weigh those, and since spanish people speak fast, its hard for me to pick up alot of what they're saying, but just keep up the good work.####$$##%POSITIVE
The price has actually gone down! That's why I never had it when I was younger, cost too much then. It has become completely worth it, having it now. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought the boxed sets for German, Italian, and Japanese.  I would never consider total online because when we get wind storms in the winter, the cable can go out, hence no internet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well Maybe I'll Consider Buying It, If The Price Has Lowerd.####$$##%NEGATIVE
^Really not happy about this. They took away the boxed set for mine.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wait a minute, so they are going to take the box sets out for all the languages? If they do that they are going to lose a lot of customers. I hope they dont phase out the box set of Brazilian Portuguese before June.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I receive an error code 9114.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm learing Swedish and they made it all online now! :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Plus, I'm almost done with my last level, and they haven't added any.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please DON'T phase out the boxed sets!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please DON'T phase out the boxed sets!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Korean and Japanese still only have 3 levels.####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS says it takes about 500 total hours for a 5 level course. But it won't make you fluent in a language, just conversational.####$$##%NEGATIVE
you guys are still way too expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They aren't that expensive, immagine the price of taking just 3 levels of a language course in college, even at a community college your looking at 4-10x that ammount####$$##%POSITIVE
i think the should lower it to atleast 100 for a course####$$##%NEGATIVE
And Rosetta Stone actually also has a very good program to learn a language fast and efficiently from home......####$$##%POSITIVE
They do have to make money considering the amount of work that goes into making a program like this.  Is it cheap just looking at the price?  No, of course not.  But when you look at everything you get for it, it is pretty cheap when compared to college/university courses, etc.  If you want cheap, I suggest buying a book and seeing what you get out of your $100.00####$$##%POSITIVE
I had the pre-Totale (version 3) CD's for Spanish and now have the Totale (version 4) CD's for French. The interface is a bit different, but either way you are loading the entire course onto your computer via CD (i.e. 500 hours for the 5 level course), plus the MP3's for your iPod or other portable player. The "Rosetta World" portion is separate from the CD course & that's the part that you pay for monthly (after the 3 months free); it includes live lessons via webcam, games, and links to other students to study with online. It's actually quite cool! After trying out the free months on my French course, I upgraded my old Spanish course to get the live lessons & games too!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it really works. Have you read any of the customer reviews?####$$##%POSITIVE
I've never had a problem####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I went on youtube to hear some reviews and they were not very good overall####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried to join a studio session this morning and had streaming issues. The audio/video kept "choking." Has anyone else experienced this problem?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am using the software for Hebrew and I find it very effective. I'm a little over halfway through Level 2. I wouldn't want to use any other program, myself.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes, I have had that same problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It WILL work if you put in the time.  No pain, no gain.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, I hope my model is added soon!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! Glad to be back!####$$##%POSITIVE
My first session was awesome! I haven't had the second one over the unit I had just finished. That is this Saturday.####$$##%POSITIVE
Go for it .!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Muy bien Donald!####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 2 was the worst for me, Level 3 is a little challenging, when I finish all the levels I am going to redo them starting from the middle of level 2.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Its a pretty good program, I learned a lot from this, but if youre going to get it, buy some other materials too like a dictionary, and another spanish book, in overall I give this a 8 out of 10.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hmm, the navigation menu is still in japanese characters. I'm trying to login to totale####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not available yet for HTC Incredible.####$$##%NEGATIVE
College classes are expensive as well, but it doesn't mean RS isn't still pretty pricey. $179 for the first disc, $299 for the first and second and still going up from there up to a whopping $499.  Compare it to college classes all you want but $499 is a lot of money.  Hell, $179 is REALLY expensive for some software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I spent $150 on Living Language only to find out it is just the same old look at a workbook & listen to a tape format, what a waste of money! RS is different, it works, and I actually use it. I love it!!! And wondering why people who just want to complain even follow them on Facebook...?####$$##%POSITIVE
I used to complain about Rosetta Stone prices but once I finally pulled the trigger I found they're not that bad. You get A LOT of material. I've taken college courses and feel those are more of a waste of money and time, while you get to keep the Rosetta Stone software indefinitely.####$$##%POSITIVE
muy buen curso le pongo un 10 exelente !!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Kiosks are the perfect setting to try out the whole software before you buy so you get a really good feel for its in depthness, AND have someone knowledgeable there from whom to get guidance and answers regarding the worth-every-penny software. Of course, I'm biased. :). I've taken my fair share of university language classes. And two years of a serious relationship with Rosetta Stone languages (Chinese, Russian, Polish, Dutch, German) :)))####$$##%POSITIVE
I have 11 Rosetta Stone Languages and it doesn't like ANY of my pronuniciations! Therefore, I have scaled back our relationship!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think people complain of price because some people really don't have the money and you can't get mad at that. Of course everyone wants to get ahead of this and have an opportunity to be able to do something to better themselves. The price is high for me I  a single mom who wants to learn a language for more then just pleasure, but I can't afford it. I'm not mad at RS I just wish I could honestly go thru them for a better a deal vs Craig's list or amazon for an older program that may work or may not work and do it right####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have my pronunciation set on the hardest and I get nearly everything right, so you might need to fix something.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta stone is worth every penny. Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
if only Rosetta stone offered these languages. it would make my life a whole lot simpler.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i live in a poor household so the possibility of moving to another country rite now is unlikely. plus i have no interest in learning Russian. Georgian and Armenian are the only two languages i want to speak. i think it is stupid that they only offer languages that are the most popular and don't offer the ones that people like me want to learn. i am very passionate about Georgian and Armenian and the cultures behind the languages and it really ticks me off that i have to go threw hell trying to learn them because Rosetta stone only cares about the languages that most people want to learn. i know several people who are trying to learn Georgian and they have to go threw they same hell as me because there are very few sources for learning it. sure we could go to Georgia and take the language courses they offer there but the classes cost like $2,000+ for like 4 weeks of learning. THANK YOU ROSETTA STONE FOR NOT OFFERING GEORGIAN OR ARMENIAN.####$$##%NEGATIVE
even if i got all the learning books and stuff it still wouldn't be as good of learning experience as Rosetta Stone supposedly provides.####$$##%POSITIVE
Born in Romania, grew up in Germany, lived in Israel for 10 years and learned French in school which I still practice a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have always been fascinated with those languages as a start.a lot of my family's heritage is German,so I though it would be an awesome challenge to learn it.i started a few years back but faltered and didn't stick to my lessons.about 5months ago I started picking it back up and reviewing what I had lost,at the same time I decided to buy the Russian pack as well...just a language I have always been fascinated with.my girlfriend speaks fluent Russian so it's Great to go over things and stay fresh.I am enjoying every lesson,your program has always been and will be the best there is.If you put your mind and time to it,the program does what it's promised to, no gimmicks. I look forward the future and what's to come !####$$##%POSITIVE
sorry, but is just bad!!! this morning i wasted 2 hrs trying to connect...now back home from work im trying to connect and the message says: No Online Access You don't have online access for this language right now. To practice, sign in through the RWorld site. ...what's that??? a joke####$$##%NEGATIVE
i was very exited...but now...i think was just another "on-line big catch"####$$##%NEGATIVE
But nothing happened. I entered my email at start, then competed the interactive demo and games. I didn't fill out an entry form, it didn't say congratulations you are entered or anything.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok thanks, we are going to order the Russian.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ooh;) your spanish is getting better every day;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
We deleted and reinstalled to ap... Now it's not automatically taking me back to the beginning after I complete each part... Instead of continuing like it did before....Help! I'm so frustrated!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, it works.  You will learn a lot of vocabulary.  Some people pick up the languages quite easily.  Others, like me, struggle...but I've used Rosetta Stone for German and even though it hasn't made me fluent, it was a very good start.  I'm continuing with an instructor-led class.  My next language will be Italian, and I'm going to start that with Rosetta Stone..I've already purchased Italian Levels 1-5.  I'm assuming I'll have to follow it with an instructor-led class, but at least I'll have a good foundation.####$$##%POSITIVE
Good lord, your old man must be a genius. You shouldnt have any problems learning a language. I am also using RS spanish, its awesome, i am stilll having an issue with conditional past, but its good.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your helpful reply. So do you say if I increase the speech precision level to the highest, it will not let me go to the nex slide if only the intonation is correct? I will give it a try to check it. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok. Cool. Thanks. Yeh I play the games everyday and do 2 studio sessions per unit! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Credit card and I just checked and yes...the refund shows now on my card!  Thanks RS####$$##%POSITIVE
Tell me one reason Ipad application is not available in Finland!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why not? And why not Ipad totale companion is not available? However totale-products are possible to buy from eu-site. Could it be possible to have it also to finnish appstore?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I cant wait to get this on my bday in June.####$$##%POSITIVE
They have payment plans.####$$##%POSITIVE
Twenty dollars a month? That's not bad. =) I'd like to learn German, French, Italian, Russian, and Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hm, alright. Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you that was very helpful####$$##%POSITIVE
i was very exited...but now...i think was just another "on-line big catch"####$$##%NEGATIVE
how can i talk in my "new language" play games and chat with native speakers if i dont have the course i paid for??? the only words i learned are boy and girl...i trying to say I PAID for the famous ROSETTA STONE PROGRAM online and now you guys give me a free version???? i just like to find a solution... if i paid i like to get the product, if you guys dont have a solution just refund my money...what's that????????####$$##%NEGATIVE
now is working, im very happy!!!! sorry about the hard time :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I installed my course in my old computer.. Now I got a new computer and Im trying to install the course and then It send a message that My activation ID is already in other computer.. So, I can not use my course in my new computer.... I have been sending emails to Rosetta Stone's and I dont get any reply!.. I appreciate your help.. Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
The software is about $400 for 3 levels.  Each level is 4 units.  EAch unit is 4 lessons, plus you get focus lessons on writing, vocabulary, pronunciation, etc.  THe online portion is free for 3 months, but then you have to pay.  I paid $75 for 6 months, but I can take as many online classes as I want  - with a native speaker of the language.  Also, I can play games - by myself, with other learners or with native speakers - and I can listen to stories.  YOu get a lot for your money, and it isn't cheap.  If they lowered the price, it would be garbage.  You need to catch the sales, if you are interested.####$$##%POSITIVE
nah the way i see it theres alot of things tht arent garbage they dont charge you tht much cause they cant keep up the software if they dont soo it woulndt be garbage if they charged you less they just think there software is worth tht much tis all.. nd i think its worth less difference in a opinion thts all i mean if i could afford it id pay tht much but i cant soo if you pay 400 hundred for snearkers are they worth less than the same sneakers you pay 20 dollars for? i think not...####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is a refresher for me.  I was born in Germany but came to the States when I was only 6.  After my mother and I learned English, she wouldn't speak German in the house anymore.  So, here I am 49 years  old.  The material obviously comes very easy to me but I needed some practice that I couldn't get anywhere else.   No one I know speaks German.####$$##%POSITIVE
now is working, im very happy!!!! sorry about the hard time :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is cheaper and a better investment in my book####$$##%POSITIVE
Most people only complain about the price of RS, but never go further. You have to know what you are buying.  RS is sophisticated software.  Also, you need to do comparisons.  Level 2 in RS gives future and past tenses so that you can really communicate after three levels.  Most first semester language classes only give present tense and cost more than RS.  My local college charges $360 for one semester and the books are over $100.  PLUS you have to get to the college (gas, bus, catch a ride), whereas with RS, you can study at home.####$$##%POSITIVE
At least with RS you can still learn a language in your pajamas :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you ^__^ before I did about an hour when I did it so hopefully. Just stressing since its my senior year. Thank you though! I will try my hardest!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Ashleigh....I adore this program!! :o)####$$##%POSITIVE
is it expensive?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Lesttley, no, it isn't expensive. Only a little over 600 a pop! Also, it seems quite un-realistic for these people to be fantasizing about learning all of these languages at once, not to mention the cost. Good luck with that. At least Rosetta is laughing all the way to the bank! ####$$##%POSITIVE
When is my headset going to be sent?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am just worried about getting confused looking at the exact same pictures in the same sequence, on the other hand, at least  I will know what the pictures are trying to say!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've got it setup now but the sound still comes out through the laptop speakers and not the headset. please help####$$##%NEGATIVE
also are you supposed to start with the core lesson or start the little blocks first as I tried the core lesson and failed quite badly?####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok, when will the product support member be on? will they send me a message or talk to me on this wall? So it is the core lesson first then the little blocks after? I've been really looking forward to using rosetta stone and I wanna make sure i'm using it the recommended way x####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jag studerar Svenska. Just started recently. It is a blast! Such a lyrical language.####$$##%POSITIVE
i am an average person and I was able to buy it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Same here. I think it's best to buy when they have sales.####$$##%POSITIVE
It isn't expensive for what you get.  If you are really interested in learning a language, it is an investment in yourself.  Do you even know what you get for the money - before you say it is expensive?####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't have rosetta stone yet but it will be cheaper than going paying a college language course. I took 2 yrs in college of Italian and each class of 3 credit hrs were 300 dollars per credit hour. This was back in 2003 or so.####$$##%POSITIVE
With Rosetta Stone, you will be hearing the language throughout the whole course and getting practice with your accent/pronunciation throughout, as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Use the Studio sessions. With the on-line services you can take as many as you want. It's a 50 minute live session with a natvie speaker and up to 4 learners.####$$##%POSITIVE
Привіт мій wat sam ім'я є ур  that would be UKRAINIAN####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow! Thanks for the response. I'm learning 2 languages with Rosetta Stone, really like the program, just this issue that began a few days ago.####$$##%POSITIVE
Eu estou usando Rosetta studio mas eu vou continuar obrigada RS!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am learning german now.  Enjoying it.  Have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Me too!  I started level 4 yesterday :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, I think she'll get over it. The only thing is that I made some mistakes because I couldn't stop laughing with her silly behaviour xD . But that just gives me an excuse to practice some more :-) ..####$$##%POSITIVE
That's cool.####$$##%POSITIVE
INTERESTING fact...I have a Germany trip coming up and this is for Janice Kennedy...I bought a German/Spanish phrase book!  I can understand ALL the Spanish.  That is a GREAT feeling!####$$##%POSITIVE
we love to draw manga and anime and sing in japanese so we're also thinking about taking a visit to japan !!####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool, thanks, Sean. And, yeah, mistakes are always fun (and helpful!) when you're getting real language exposure.####$$##%POSITIVE
it told me to reinstall it, so i did then it said "the system cannot find the file specified" what do i do now?####$$##%NEGATIVE
back to application fatal error 1141. i have reinstalled and done everything that your website and about 15 other websites tell me to do and i still have the same error, if there is soemthing that i should know that isnt on your website please tell me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@christy thanks christy but I have resolved it, my error changed to 2102, I think, and I re-downloaded it :) ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hej! The Swedish program is going great! förbereder mig för framtida resa! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Very good point Donald...####$$##%POSITIVE
The 1-5 box set for Spanish at Best Buy is $500 the community college near my house offers Spanish at ~$65 a level. 500/65=7.69231 I could take Spanish 1-5 there then have enough left over to take one of their Adv Conversation, Spanish for Healthcare Personnel, Spanish Immersion, Spanish Culture, or Review Courses.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree Donald. I bought all five levels of German. After the first week I could tell it was well worth the cost. I've learned a lot already and I'm just in the third unit of level one. ####$$##%POSITIVE
That's a good price Geoffrey. If my school offered it at that price I would have stayed there. I didn't have to worry about gas because the school let us ride the city bus for free.  They're probably not the only school that does that. I'm still going to eventually take classes again. I can't right now because I am not in an area where I can get to a school so I have to use things like RS. When I move I will be able to. The one big advantage to me about going out to school is the friends I met that were learning that language too.####$$##%POSITIVE
I compared the price of the Rosetta Stone software with the cost of taking a language course for a semester at a local college, and it was comparable.   But for me, the added convenience of being to do the course at home (even the Studio) also made it worth the price.####$$##%POSITIVE
that is what so special about nyc! I love living here. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Jennifer you should also try www.meetup.com, I meet up with a French group here in DC and I get to use what I am learning from RS, RS is really priceless.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ben, The operative words in your correct posting are "within the first several years of their lives." THAT was exactly my point. I agree, that anyone using the Rosetta Stone program assidously for several years would achieve a high level of fluency. Anyone who believes that such an achievement can happen with very little effort is sadly deceived.####$$##%NEGATIVE
same here i want to learn spanish but its tooooooooooooo expensive####$$##%NEGATIVE
Much better session!  Amazing what a week and some repetition can do!  I can't believe I am actually learning Farsi?!####$$##%POSITIVE
i went on tha website already but i cant afford dem kind of funds dey they asking for?####$$##%NEGATIVE
By the way, my computer is a mac, not sure if thats the issue or not. Also, when I do log in, I try to download the update for totale but it always fails, while receiving "fatal error 1141". Can you help me with that as well?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like it!####$$##%POSITIVE
omg i was able 2 understand what u wrote I LOVE RS L.A. SPANISH####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I will! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have to admit that the studios helped me get over my fear of speaking German.  After 8 classes at the university, I was afraid to speak 2 words.  Now, I can communicate and put sentences together.  If speaking a language is your (anyone's) goal, then this is invaluable!####$$##%POSITIVE
Generally. Its too hard.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah I just talked to an RS representative on the phone and he explained it to me. Unfortunately Arabic isn't available with the 20 a month online program. That's the one I really want to do. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Word. It's so EXPENSIVE.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I completed Rosetta Stone Spanish (Latin America) almost a month ago.  I am gaining fluency by doing a studio class every day.####$$##%POSITIVE
I completed 5 levels of German. IMHO, RS is a foundation or a springboard. It gets you to communicate in the language.  I practice with native speakers in my town and over SKYPE.  I also read and write (I have penpals in German-speaking countries).  True fluency comes with using the language constantly (such as living in the country where it is spoken).####$$##%POSITIVE
I have finished RS German Levels 1-5 and am nowhere near fluent.  I have a good vocabulary, and can understand much of what I read, but am not conversational.  I agree with Janice...it's a starting point.####$$##%POSITIVE
Buena Suerte. ( Good Luck)####$$##%POSITIVE
I took it in Jr high and High School and I loved it..We are always vacationing and I think it's a must have.. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I accidentally bought a fraudulent copy of Spanish v3 online as well. Currently, I'm trying to get my money back so I can buy the real deal. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
My friend bought a fraudulent copy of RS Spanish 1-5 off of Craigslist.  I think it contained only the limited portion of each lesson that it let's you do without activation so it was a little while before he reallized it was bad.  They are made somewhere overseas and are wrapped and packaged to look very authentic.  I recommend buying directly from RS as he was out a good bit of money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did the same thing Mark. I didn't know this was a problem until after the fact. I'm currently trying to obtain a refund from the seller but I doubt that will ever materialize. I will say that Rosetta Stone has been very helpful upon hearing my of my issues & they are assisting me with my attempts to rectify the situation. No matter the end result, I will buy the authentic product directly from RS soon. ####$$##%POSITIVE

Paypal is really burning my biscuits lately, I'd like to find an alternative site to use.  I don't think they actually took the time to read my complaint at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
And for what it is worth, if you are going to sell language software, your manager should never give a person a look of disgust when they state they want to learn Hebrew.  They should also never state "Why on EARTH would you want to learn that" and give me a sneer.  That is unprofessional.  I expect more out of sales people.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please do because I really am upset about all of this.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I only just now got it (about 5 minutes ago) when I was trying to send you a message.  Apparently FB didn't tell me that I was sent one and it wasn't in my inbox.  Don't worry I am going to give you everything I experienced and then if you want more details I can tell you more.  I wish I could tag you in the conversation I had on FB, but I will instead try to copy and paste it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks! I'll take a look ####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes and same as milestone I can talk on it and that's all their stone is so don't k ow why it's locked out of iPad it means I actually have to go on the computer to finish tasks before moving on   Other than that it's great in the iPad I prefer it than the comp.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the quick response! I'm opening a Montessori School ages 3-6, in one month! Sooo.... I keep hearing great things about Rosetta Stone. Id love to offer some foreign language.. help!!  Any suggestions or should I Just use the same link?####$$##%POSITIVE
Too bad then. But then it is possible to buy only the online access, right? It's just that it's quite expensive, $299 for 12 months. Again, thanks a lot for the info!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am in Level 4 French and have found it much more difficult than 1-3. I think it has to do with the nuances of speech now...until, then, since, during, etc. I have been struggling on this level for a while and also seem "stuck". I do try to suck it up and so a little every day, even if just listening to CD or Xirius Canadian.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Haha cool. I was thinking to myself the other day that all of my German studio coaches have been female so far. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I only have one male Japanese coach so far in all Japanese Studios I have attended(his name is Yoshi). His accent was different than the male voices from RS course. He is funny. I only have female coaches in Italian.  I wish RS hires more male coaches.####$$##%POSITIVE
and I wish I could just say dix-neuf quatre-vingt huit instead.... alas, I don't think I can change the french language : (####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have a similar issue with spanish, like one sentence said she was born in 1952 and I couldnt say mil novecientos cincuenta y dos.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thanks, will do!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Tony!!  I'll try it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I completed all 5 levels of German, am in level 2 of Italian, and just started Japanese with RS.  I would say that it is a good way to get a foundation in the language.  For me, it is a course - I use other materials, such as grammar books, etc.  RS gives you focus on certain areas, and the online portion is invaluable.  I hesitated for a long time before I actually bought RS, but it really helped.  I had 8 German courses at the university, and was still afraid to speak the language.  AFter RS, I started speaking and speak to native speakers (in person and over SKYPE).  IMHO, in order to get truly fluent, you need to do more than RS or any course - you need to speak/hear/read/write the language.  RS will help you communicate  in the language, but true fluency is up to you and further activities.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think Rosetta Stone is totally worth it (and I'm learning Japanese as well so HI!). Yeah, its expensive but it teaches you exactly how you learned English or whichever happens to be a person's first language.   It's much easier--I think, and this is just my opinion--looking at a picture and putting a word to it. For instance, when you say "dog" in English, a dog pops into your head, doesn't it? I didn't even notice until I started using RS.  Or when you see a "cat", your brain recognizes that furry little animal right there is a feline--a cat.   I think it's totally worth the money.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree you need to also use add-ons a little. The advantage to Rosetta is that it is actually fun! It's great to play the games andi interact with live native-speaking coaches.  Fun way to learn a language and not boring.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree.  It is fun!  I use RS and go to meetups in the languages.  I also have joined social clubs for the languages.  It helps to actually use the languages, and it is a great feeling to actually communicate and someone understands!!####$$##%POSITIVE
im learning german n french, it's hard to learn but im really impressed :) ####$$##%POSITIVE
I highly recommend trying Rosetta Stone, but if it's that urgent, you could try Rocket Languages...####$$##%POSITIVE
oh ok, aw man I was hoping they had Croation :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good choice. I'm on the last level of Japanese. I love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cool! I just started I'm only on level one core 2. And whats motivating me? Just the simple fact that I find Japan extremely fascinating. I plan to visit this summer. And possibly move there when I turn 21. Six more years to go :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Its a good building block, but just dont rely on RS, you have to use other resources as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's true. I have learned a lot with RS. Much more than I thought I would. But you do have to use other sources which I do. I want to start watching more Japanese movies when I finish.####$$##%POSITIVE
http://www.rosettastone.com/wt-tosub/learn-german - Do you see the wt-tosub in there?  That's the difference but even when I took it out it kept forwarding me back to that page.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good luck. I love the sessions. I have one tomorrow in German.####$$##%POSITIVE
wow i'm still waiting and i they told me that my wait time was less than 15 minutes####$$##%NEGATIVE
They are an auditory based learning program, I doubt it. Lexi tried their Japanese level 1 and was not impressed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like JOlanda!  She has a great sense of humor and is bubbly!####$$##%POSITIVE
When the session started it was a lot of fun and she was bubbly. Then the problems started after around the third slide. I was mad because up till then I was answering all her questions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Alex: I was upset earlier but I'm okay now. I will schedule another session. I would like to practice German as much as possible. I'm glad to know what the problem was.  Carol: I didn't know either. But I'm kind of glad in this case because I get to know what happened.####$$##%POSITIVE
it does however you have to make an effort and do it often, at least an hour a day.. it is also a lotta fun####$$##%POSITIVE
I work in a casino and work around a lot of Asian customers. I am learning manderian and find that I know a lot of words already and sometimes pick up on a few words that my customers are using. It isn't easy but it is fun and I am learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
When I called yesterday the guy told me that subscription option was expired (like a week) and in fact that his webpage showed up as the DVD price.  He even offered to sell me the discs over the phone.  Right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Every other language on there sells the CDs.  German is the only subscription which I find odd.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They should sell if for the same $399 at the kiosk.  I'm sure that they will work with you.####$$##%POSITIVE
i spend at least two hours and i speak to native speakers alot.  i wanna say anyone can do it but it takes perserverance and patience i however have a gift for it. but rosetta stone is well worth it####$$##%POSITIVE
Español getting ready to start level 3. Absolutely love it so far!####$$##%POSITIVE
the iPad app is amazing.  Just sayin####$$##%POSITIVE
no, there were no technical issues, its that the program doesnt teach the languages very well, one can learn as much from your course as a student going to 2 weeks of a language class, which is practically nothing####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am on level 2 of Italian.  In level two, they introduce future and past tenses (level 1 is present tense).  I am also enrolled in an Italian class at the local university and believe that I am learning more with RS (and speaking more) than in the class.  I finished 5 levels of German, and it really helped me with pronunciation and communication skills (after 8 classes in German at the university).  RS is a good product to get a foundation in the language.  The online portion (the studios in particular) are a wonderful challenge.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm with Janice. Don't expect to become fluent with just RS. I have finished German levels 1-5 and am nowhere near fluent but I have a good vocabulary thanks to RS. I am now taking an instructor led class for German to get the missing pieces. I have already bought RS Italian and plan on starting that before taking instructor led Italian classes. RS is a good base, a good starting point. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I advice u to buy it !. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Very good product.  I finished a 5-level language and am working on two more with RS.  It gives you a good foundation without constantly translating to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's brilliant. I did all 5 levels of French (plus what I learnt at school 12 years ago) and now I'm doing Spanish. I've recommended it to my friends and family and wouldn't if I thought it wouldn't work for them. I also plan on doing mandarin when I have finished Spanish. I know it works and that's why I would always use it and trust it to teach me any of the languages I desire. Also it's on sale so no better time to buy.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm almost finished Japanese and so far I have loved it. I have learned a lot. I have started on a level 5 language so I know I will be learning even more with that language. I have another level three language after that.  Later in the year once I'm finished the languages I have I may get Russian, Mandarin & French.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got help with your support team. Very sweet and very helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
You're welcome! I only recommend it because I know it works! ;) .......Some of them are learning the languages I know and so I will test them at some point! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Liam: I do the same. A friend of mine and my mother want to buy RS. They each want a different language. I'm trying to get my mother to buy cd version of LA Spanish so I can be her second user.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do it! Spanish is brilliant. I'm So glad I'm learning it. And I find my French skills actually help me learn it even more effectively. In about 2 years time I want to learn mandarin, a completely different type of language and then maintain the others. Then I'm done!!!! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
There are many more languages I want to do. I know I want to do french once I'm done the languages I have.  I want to move somewhere where French is a first or second language. I have at least 6 more before I'm finished with RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
6?! Wow! You go girl!####$$##%POSITIVE
MI MAESTRO HAROLD WAS GREAT####$$##%POSITIVE
It was great interacting with the other learners.  I understand the derivation of the verbs much better now. I also liked how Michelle typed out the words I was having a hard time with and also helped me enunciation better.   I can't wait for my next studio session!####$$##%POSITIVE
still can't do it :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes :) its good if you already know some Japanese, i grew up with speaking around me. I like it very much because you get to learn reading and writing and for the writing you can switch inbetween Hiragana and Katakana, Kanji, which is based off of chinese, or romaji, which i dont recommend because its not used in japan.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree w/ Derek. Only use romaji for pronunciation purposes. Learn hiragana and katakana first before jumping to kanji. You can learn kanji characters by using hiragana characters. The program provides a good base for learning Japanese in general. Since RS does not teach how to write the characters, I suggest that you can buy a book for writing them. I have been using it for almost a year and I like it. I did not have a background in japanese before using RS. Now, I can have conversations with native Japanese people.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your helpful comments####$$##%POSITIVE
You will def want to buy the other 4 levels too! You're gonna love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you soo much! Will post updates####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it was very informative! I had no idea what the schedule sessions ass about####$$##%POSITIVE
sorry was about. So I'm glad I signed up for the social session.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Italian. I speak the dialect my parents are from Italy and that's what I was taught so it's a little hard,  I guess it's better when you don't speak it at all.####$$##%POSITIVE
my first intrigue in the language was to do away with subtitles lol but i love the language also , i wanna learn as many languages as i can in life its a goal of mine , its just always been hard to find a good learning source , this is just the first one ive picked up with rosetta stone####$$##%POSITIVE
I just did the Dutch demo, VERY COOL!  It is like a mixture of German and English.  If you know those two languages I would think Dutch would be easy!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks much for your quick response.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the same problem...can't roll my r's.  Is there someone with a hint on how to learn to do this?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much. I'm excited to continue using your excellent program!####$$##%POSITIVE
On - or by - March 4th, there will be 1,000,000.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, it works well. No product is going to get you to a high level of fluency; in other words, for any program, you're going to want to branch out and get other exposure to the language outside of that program. That is how fluency building generally works. But Rosetta Stone is the best product I have found for language acquisition. Once you progress through the software you can utilize http://www.sharedtalk.com/ to continue your fluency development.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been learning Russian with it for months now and I love it. Its definitely worth it. I would learn the alphabet first though. It will prepare you so much more.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the reply!  Ive gotten through the first few lessons and I really enjoy it!  Im trying to find people to play the games with to practice.  So if anyone is interested let me know!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rachel. My favorite part is the Milestone lesson####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning spanish!  I can already understand much of what is said but I never can answer back. This has been a problem for years so finally I bought your program. Even though I have taken spanish before I am starting at the beginning to make sure I finally get it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Your right. I love languages but hate grammar and I promise we did not learn much grammar in English class at school! I have no idea what the different tenses are called or what a direct pronoun is or intransitive and transitive verbs are but I still speak perfect English because I am English. I guess if you use it enough, it will stick. That is why RS works and why I enjoy it! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It is great to hear the experience of someone that actually used it and earned something...thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
The problem for me with rosetta stone is that sometimes I am not actually sure what they are doing in the picture or what the thing is and there is no english equivalent in case I am wrong.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My only problem is RS doesnt really stress enough about grammar, and there are somethings that I cant figure out myself, and with me if its not explained to me in the most simpliest way, I have trouble understanding.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I, too, think there should be a little more emphasis on the grammar aspect.  It is hard to figure out on our own at times.  I am doing the RS Spanish and I took Spanish years ago in college so I have a basic understanding of some of the aspects of the grammar but I'm not always sure that I remember it correctly.  I guess repetition is the name of the game when learning a language, like Liam stated above.  Seems to be sticking if I don't try to think it through too much.  In college I think they put too much emphasis on the grammar aspect (which I seemed to learn to pass the test and then forgot!) and I didn't seem to be able to converse on an every day level.  RS beats that kind of learning hands down!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh I have sorted the problem now thanks to your Q & A page :)    Back to learning Turkish :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Tesekkur ederim :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I did - the presences button appears but it only allows me to change the settings for the lesson - it does not give me access to my account information. I just want to be able to have access to my billing information and my subscription details. Thank You.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You are right ! Rosetta stone is great product !####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning English(American version).I won't regret to buy it ,because it is so helpful !!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am getting basic understanding of a language.  The only way to learn to speak, is to speak.  You must seek out people to talk to, or get yourself to the country and really work at it.  RS is really fun, and you can learn a great deal, IF you really stick to it!  I'm only at level 1 in Italian, but I have learned much more vocabulary, the grammar is going to take some work!  IRosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I eventually want to move to France or Quebec. So my motivation is pretty high.####$$##%POSITIVE
congrats its a good program####$$##%POSITIVE
Susan, I knew when I purchased the program only one person is allotted the online access.  You guys can work and learn together though. There is an online Rosetta Stone Social tonight at 8:00 PM with Christine Durakis. They explain a lot about the program and have a question and answer session as well.  :)  It is a great program you guys will enjoy it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeh I did know that. And even with both you paying for online access it is still well worth the money! Similar online languages classes are very expensive and not unlimited either.####$$##%POSITIVE
Alex, the application has been deleted and reinstalled.  I then downloaded all the lessons. Then it stopped working. I haven't learned how to download the lessons through itunes if it possible to do that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes I just got it. Thanks so much. =]####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I'm going to be a translater and Japan is a beautiful country!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm appreciated your help so much! Alex, I did what you told me to ,and that's work.I'm fixed of my mic . It's nice of you to tell me that. Thanks again.####$$##%POSITIVE
I hate when this happens, one day I am all for it, then the next day, I dont want to do it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I used to live in Germany back when I was in the Army, loved it, I was thinking about learning German after I finish learning Spanish and Portuguese. Why are you learning German?####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm just in love with the language and I think its so beautiful. I've tried learning other languages but I keep getting bored and drawn back in to German :)  However, I live both in the US and very close to the border of Quebec, so Spanish and French are both next on my list. I know quite a bit of Spanish, probably to an intermediate level, where I can pretty much comprehend all I read, but my speaking, listening and writing needs major work. I'm waiting for both languages to be $20/month- this way I   can get the program for cheaper and schedule multiple studio sessions- they have REALLY helped to improve my spoken German!####$$##%POSITIVE
I admire U Guys!####$$##%POSITIVE
If you want to upgrade to Version 4 from 3, you have to download. But that's not what I was referring to. The process of upgrading on a new computer is terrible.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Call tech support on Monday.  They should be able to help you.  I had a lot of problems in the beginning, and they were very helpful. If the tech person is not helpful at first, ask to elevate to the next level.####$$##%POSITIVE
Amazing! Thank you! I'll let you know how it goes.####$$##%POSITIVE
It worked. Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias! Lo que pasa es que si me lo solicita y no me deja continuar si no lo escribo. Además luego de que pague con mi tarjeta y apareció mi numero de activación, el problema es q no pude anotarlo!! Pero voy a intentarlo. Otra pregunta: para asistencia telefónica si vivo en Costa Rica a que numero puedo llamar? Buen día ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Muchísimas gracias! Tan pronto lo haga le aviso el resultado!! Bendiciones ####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias, funciono!! muy amable por tu ayuda, y me encanta me parece super facil!! Recomendado####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias !   I am on lesson 4 only 1 week in but am enjoying the best refresher course available. Wish I had bought Totale for the games & sessions.####$$##%POSITIVE
Japaness and i mite learn more####$$##%POSITIVE
Sean, that worked, thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
but, a day, i wrote them, and they answered me that they only sell it for companies####$$##%NEGATIVE
¡Si! Each level is comprised of 4 units. I'm sure you will enjoy the experience, as I am with German, y español es muy divertido :) ¡Buena suerte!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, its fine now. I went away for several hours. Now I started it up and its OK. Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes my mom bought that yesterday and she bot me spanish you have to call them to get the 399$ deal hope this helps there number is on there website####$$##%POSITIVE
You are so kind! Thank you for your input, it means a lot :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It IS difficult but well worth it :) I'm doing the German program as well and now is the best time to start, because the German online program is only $20/month. Viel Glück!####$$##%POSITIVE
Brilliant! It's definitely getting harder, and it was only a level 1 unit 3 studio session! It did ok though. I'm doing at least 3 studios per unit so I will do better next time! Thanks for asking! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just love being able to speak even a little Spanish. 4 weeks ago I didn't speak a word!####$$##%POSITIVE
I &hearts; the studio sessions! I am currently in German Level 1, Unit 2 and about to take the Unit 2 studio but I am doing the same as you and I have attended the Unit 1 studio 3 times. I just love all the extra speaking practice! Glad to hear you are enjoying the L.A. Spanish program, as that is next on my list :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Just finished french level 1, unit 2 studio.. Very good and jumped right in to schedule a second unit 2 studio to improve.####$$##%POSITIVE
I completed all 5 levels of French and it really helped me. I love both languages and hope to get my Spanish at the same levels as my French! I want to be advanced in both, fluency is difficult unless you can fully immerse yourself, and although I would love to live and work in both French and Spanish speaking countries, it may never happen! I'm happy with advanced though! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Kim, your English seems very good and way beyond Level 3 lol :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, Ben :) I am mostly working on my pronunciation which, for an L2 learner, can be very difficult to get spot on.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank You. It's working now =D####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. I did follow the directions on the link. I haven't had time to repeat the unit yet. If it's still a problem, I'll get in touch. Thank you for your prompt response.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am one of the biggest critics of this program, but I also recognize the advantages...and recognize that some people have had huge success with it.  I have taken the full 5 level program for German. Overall, it did not find it met my full expectations. That being said, I do think the program is a good start to language learning, and I've already bought RS Italian (yup, trying to learn another language i won't be fluent in).  Although I may not ever be fluent, I think I will get enough to help me in my travels...and I travel a lot.  Some people (like me) don't learn languages easily...while others do.  My experience is very different than the experiences of many others on the fan page.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think the problem is that people expectations is high for this program, at first when I brought this program I thought that it would make me fluent, but I learned that there is not a language program out there that will make you fluent, even If you go to a university you still wont be fluent unless you use other resources. I have Spanish(Latin America) and my only problem is speaking it, probably cause I am chicken and I dont feel like I am ready to speak to someone yet and I prefer to be face to face instead of going on skype, RS is a good start point, its up to you to reach the finish line.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Donald, but I think Rosetta Stone itself is the reason people have such high expectations.  Their ads and promotional material make it seem like it will be so easy.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree - you need more than just RS to get you fluent in a language.  RS will help you communicate, but you have to have the drive and the desire to take it to the next level.  I have to say that using RS helped me get conversant in Italian.  I am now taking an Italian class at the local university, and I find that the class is hindering the progress that I made with RS.  THe class is so heavily grammar and translation that the purpose of the class - to learn Italian - seems to be lost.  If your goal is to speak the language (communicate) then I believe that RS is the way to go.  Also, I took 8 classes of German and could not put two words together to speak. After RS, I am now communicating with people in German - the classes hleped understand the grammar, but RS helped me overcome the fear of speaking.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rachel, I am learning Latin American Spanish!  I'm really enjoying the learning experience!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have used Rosetta Stone Language Programs when the City and County used to offer it in the public libraries. I would spend my whole hour allotted me without taking a break. That is how much I ENJOYED working with it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Why don't you promote Navajo on the main site with the other languages? Also, I am so glad that the people Rosetta Stone were able to save that language from ever become extinct. They have saved the seed of knowledge for another generation of the Navajo people.####$$##%POSITIVE
Super! Félicitations! Vraiment ça s'arrose ;-)####$$##%POSITIVE
yes####$$##%POSITIVE
oh, thats horrible... so I bought the korean 1-3 abot 8 months ago, but was not aware of a time limit.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I see on the Rosetta website they claim last years list price was $799 for 5 languages and now on sale for $399 but i think that is false advertising.  I have always never seen it listed over $499, so can you explain this before I contact the FTC ???? thank you####$$##%NEGATIVE
Try Fluenz (dot com) as they might have exactly what you're looking for.  They have an online demo of their program and looks like they are gonna :Dethrone the Stone" IMHO####$$##%NEGATIVE
Mia: I love my RS but I understand this if you have a smart phone you can dl an app called libro Movil and it has lots of known books in Spanish some u pay for but some free. Also I downloaded another language program called general linguistics buenos entonces it's great because it's video and people talking in Spanish, it makes me laugh watching it and very helpfull with RS and that I'm loving learning Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Bruno, try Fluenz (dot com) and check thier free demo.  and Sonia is a great motivator.  she has a channel on youtube called soniastravels you can check out.  I think you'll be quite pleased.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you for hosting them. I'm pretty new, and a college student, so I don't have too much time to explore things undirected.####$$##%POSITIVE
so i have to pay more then the disk courses i already bought?####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes i did. thanks again####$$##%POSITIVE
About a year ago. With Rosetta Stone, I learned faster than I thought I would!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone es estupendo! Yo aprendo el inglés con Rosetta Stone. Gracias por este programa.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks a lot :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Jessica. The issue has been resolved now, although there must be no record of it since I received an additional email today that assumed I still needed help (while unable to offer any). I am just left feeling disappointed and definitely hope I never have to interact with customer service again. I also mourn the time and energy I had to spend on a simple issue.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. I have received the email and appreciate your willingness to compensate me for the time and frustration. This certainly helps me be more enthusiastic about the product again.####$$##%POSITIVE
The home school demo isn't loading for some reason... in a nutshell, could you explain the difference between the home school and personal versions?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Congrats. I love the sessions.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had a studio session with Fumiko-san. She is very nice and patient person.####$$##%POSITIVE
excellent ideas thank you everyone!####$$##%POSITIVE
I teach Spanish to adults and I suggested my students to buy RS. Some of them did and are so happy, because now they can study at home and when they come to class, they can practice what they have learned. Nice!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you all for the warm welcome ... I will post updates.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sorry, but I read my email before the end of the offer. It was just that I couldn't buy online. I was trying for two days. Yesterday, I finally gave up and called but I was on hold for over an hour waiting for a customer service rep to attend. I hung up and tried throug my RS account with a live chat, but the rep didn't help me either. Instead, gave me the same phone number I called. I tried one more time and when I finally got to talk to someone, it was too late, because it was after midnight. I explained the rep all I have gone through trying to make the purchase and all I got was an "I'm sorry".####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have always been fascinated with the japanese culture and want to visit there someday and my passion for it has just rubbed off onto her haha####$$##%POSITIVE
kk and like the pictures are like hard to understand wat the pictures mean so  i got kinda confused on some of them :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
How do you get RosettaStone to quit posting on my FB page?  I never requested her and I have to wade through all her posts and Ancestry.com to get to my friends' posts.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I loved all my sessions with Martin! He is a great teacher and so much fun :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone greate product####$$##%POSITIVE
Hola y suerte con el español, i am learning English whit rosetta stone and is the best####$$##%POSITIVE
It has been a lot of fun and quite surprising to me how much I remember from school. I work in a medical field and come to meet many  Spanish speaking patients. In order to give my patients and their families comfort and care I need to be able to communicate with them without playing charades. Rosetta Stone came highly recommended by some of my colleagues.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm starting to like Pimsleur####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm surprised three people liked your comment.  Not all languages are old.  Constructed languages are rather new in comparison to natural languages.  So, sure, you could learn a new language like Klingon, Communicationssprache or Unilingua, but not with Rosetta Stone.  Rosetta Stone only offers old languages.  Learn ANOTHER language.  Open up your world.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hello Tomoyo,  I can absolutely relate to how you feel. Rosetta Stone language learning products are quite superb. Have you tried a Rosetta Studio session yet? They are very good for practicing and improving proficiency.  Best of luck, Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello　Aaron.Thank you for your comments. I have tried Rosetta Studio sessions many times. It's a very good system.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello Tony,  Congratulations on your purchase of a Rosetta Stone TOTALe product! The content taught in Rosetta Stone helps you not to necessarily achieve "fluency" but instead helps you achieve proficiency. In other words, Rosetta Stone works because it uses Dynamic Immersion to provide you with a general understanding of the language that gives you the tools to learn more of the language easily and eventually achieve fluency. Many other programs simply teach you to "parrot" common phrases and leave you like a "deer in the headlights" when you try to learn new aspects of the language. I can personally assure you that you will be more than satisfied with the Rosetta Stone TOTALe experience. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Rosetta Stone Concierge Services team at conciergeservices@rosettastone.com , at http://success.rosettastone.com, or by posting here on the Rosetta Stone Facebook Page. Best of luck on your new language-learning journey!  -Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the TOTALe version, and when I go to the... 'home screen' per se, at the bottom where the games and stories usually are, it says: "You don't have online access for this language right now./Manage Online Subscription.' I wonder what it means, so I click the button, except it won't take me anywhere. What does it mean, and why did that service vanish? Thank you for your time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
There's much better ways to learn than Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well before you can get out there in the real world, it might be nice to practice with Rosetta Stone first, duffuss.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for finding it for me. I looked at that screen twice before and never noticed the check box. :D####$$##%POSITIVE
thank u and my greatest motion was to make my parents happy. But thanks yo rossettastone and to the school that i went (:####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 2 was the worst for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
it gets better.... cnt wait for lv3####$$##%POSITIVE
Level 4 is fun, I have one more unit before I get to Level 5.####$$##%POSITIVE
Merci beaucoup Rachel! I will definitely keep everyone updated on my progress! And Nasip, I am from Portugal :) Spanish was pretty easy for me to pick up, and French was always a language that interested me! I took a year of it in college and have always wanted to be fluent...I really hope RS works for me. It's a very different way to learn a language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much guys! I'll give it a shot.####$$##%POSITIVE
 Japanese has always been the language i would love to learn because i have planned to go to Japan in my near future! I am exited to try Rosseta Stone soon.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh... riiight. Yup it went away! Thanks Shanice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Janice...you have done several languages...any input on which languages seem to have the most exciting studios?  While I liked them all...I really LOVED the Portuguese studio coaches...over the top fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Why do I need a different email address to purchase an online subscription.  I tried purchasing via the web site and via my Rosetta Stone application.####$$##%NEGATIVE
and when I put in my new gmail...this is the error I am getting now...This field is formatted incorrectly.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Doesn't like upper case letters...had to make the gmail new email without them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Holy guacamole that was the fastest customer service yet! Thank you! That was driving me knutz.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome, thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your kind  help Lawson....####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christy, I have tried all those things already and including restarting my phone.  I think deleting and reloading all exercises is a very inadequate solution to this problem.  Especially because you have to re-download each exercise separately.  I also know I'm not the only person having this issue.  I am really dissatisfied with the app now. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am having the same problem with the mobile application for iphone also.  I have downloaded the program twice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rachel, I was am having a problem with the TOTALe  Companion for iphone.  It keeps getting stuck and goes back to the home screen.  It happened to me twice.  I have contacted Apple support and he says that I need to contact the developer of the application which is Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did it! Its awesome! You should also try papaloizos publications to supplement. I went to Greek school####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok. Thanks for letting is know :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with everything Janice said.  I've repeated the level 4 and 5 studios many times and I still learn something new every time.  You can repeat as often as you like so take advantage of it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have to say that I have enjoyed all the studios.  Granted, some are better than others, but if that were the case, it wasn't the coach but the situation (tech support kept bothering, other students don't mute when they should, etc.).  Both German and Italian have been great.  I am just starting Japanese, and will most likely start Russian in the summer.####$$##%POSITIVE
All taken care of.  Thanks, Sarah.  I had to enter my new email with all lowercase letters.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ya Chris, I love it. It is solid and I love the help it gives with pronunciation.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, that's unfortunate. I personally thought maybe it could have been highly recommended, considering a few languages they have available, that I wouldn't think would be in such...demand! Maybe that's just me being jealous ;) Yet and still, I do believe they can get this particular language. Looks like I'll be spending my money on Langocity. Now that sucks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That is a good point. I agree that compensation should be given when the app does not work. I updated the app on my iPhone recently and then tried to open the app but it crashed. After several attempts to open it followed by crashes, I decided to delete it and reinstall it from the app store. That is what happened and what I had to do last time there was an update (and it had worked before). But this time, when I went to download it from the app store, I couldn't find it. I've searched for it and still can't locate the app in the app store. I think it may have been pulled.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cato, I experienced the same thing...and that's one area where RS is lacking...in the grammar department.  The use of Ein/Eine/Einer/Eines depends on the gender (masc, fem, neut) and case (object, direct object, possession).  It's so complex that you really do need to get a german grammar book or chart to help.  A good starting point is: http://german.about.com/library/blcase_sum.htm  The other part to your question is predicting gender.  For English speakers, it's a difficult concept for inanimate objects to have genders, but there are some general rules for predicting the gender of a noun: http://german.about.com/cs/vocabulary/a/nsuffix.htm####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's what I have (Mandarin).  I see they have the Duo and Simbio but there is NEVER anyone on there so I'm always doing the solo activities :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes they were, thank you. I was happy to hear of a possible 4th & 5th Level of my desired language in the future.  All the speakers yesterday were knowledgeable, energetic, and dynamic - really enjoyed it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I already had installed the program twice and downloaded all the lessons. The program stops working. It has to be deleted and reinstalled so it really isn't an issue at that point.  Everything has already been downloaded!  The Rosetta Stone application for iphone just stops working.  This is what I wrote to Alex from Rosetta Stone Success about the same issue:####$$##%NEGATIVE
12 February Tom Monahan  Alex, I have reinstalled the mobile companion recently. Problem is I have to download each individual lesson from the iphone. That is a lot of data. I have used it many times before and it worked well. What is happening now as happened before is when I click on the iphone Rosetta Stone app, my phone goes directly to home screen after checking my password and user identification.  ..  .####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have a compatible android phone and I've searched the android market for the app but I cannot find it. I tried "rosetta stone" "totale" "rosetta stone totale" and "TOTALe" Ideas?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still nothing. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 (on the list of supported phones). :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I swear by the audio companion!  Amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
I think Rosetta Stone is worth every penny!  I used the 5 payment option and it was very manageable and I am by no means wealthy.  Thank you Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone does work!  I put my new language to the test during a recent trip. I was able to speak in my new language (German) and understand what was being said to me!####$$##%POSITIVE
Damn :(  Well, thank you.  I suppose I will just have to go seek it out for myself.  Thank God Arizona isn't that far.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Interesting. . . . . . . . .####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love that. There are many languages I want to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Look into the payment plans or just get one level at a time.  It is more expensive that way, but in smaller pieces.  So many people complain about the price, but you get so much!  If you look into tutors or a college class, you will pay more and may not get as much.  Plus RS is individualized so you can go back to prior lessons with the same amount of help - college teachers do not go back except to review for a test. . . . .####$$##%POSITIVE
I have to say that I have had tutors in various languages and found it a waste.  Tutors seem to focus on what they think you do not know - whether you do or don't.  I spent a lot of money and got no where.  RS has alleviated that burden.  Now, after completing 5 levels (I have only completed language with 5 levels) I can speak to natives the town where I live, or use SKYPE.  If I take a class at the university (most are around $200) it is to network and build on what I know already.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's really awesome. I've used it for years with students.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes, NOT a fake! it works!####$$##%POSITIVE
that's awesome####$$##%POSITIVE
my motivation was when I wanted to volunteer for the israeli army, however I felt like I was too old (in fact my very first dream in hebrew pertained to the israeli army, however, the hebrew in the dream was very unclear) I had that dream long before getting rosetta stone. But now after i got rossetta stone I starting learning Hebrew, and when I had the occasional Hebrew dream some of the hebrew was more understandable####$$##%POSITIVE
i see that now! :) I did not look at the back of the card. But, that is moot now because I am getting a 2124 fatal error that is not even letting me get to the activation screen. I'm frustrated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks worked on laptop will try notebook next####$$##%POSITIVE
tried again on notebook. asks for email address and gave it a different email address. when i tried to type in password screen grays and comes up with: 5611 There was a minor error. click ok to continue. Please try again later. when i click ok it locks up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
NOT! really!!!!  CHEAPER! than tutors! AND! better! ha!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Marie, the Rosetta world will give you the confidence to speak out your new language... Sessions and games. What language are you learning? ####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm trying to learn Spanish. I've finished Level 3 but I can't hold a simple conversation. For $500 I expected more. Now my games are even gone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Who knows what's in development in RS labs.  I bet you they are going to attempt to make as many as possible!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a new machine with Windows 7.  The first language worked fine, then we upgraded to v4 with the second language and started having problems. Took a couple of days working with support to get the second language working and she had to do some stuff with the files behind the program, but it's been working fine for over a year. Now, we bought a 3rd language and all I really want is some blasted service from someone. Wish us luck.####$$##%NEGATIVE
humm good luck! i have never had any problems with customer service, but i am sorry that you have had some! keep hanging in there and hopefully it will be resolved soon!####$$##%POSITIVE
YAY!! Alex diagnosed my problem in 20 minutes! He also stayed on the line and made sure everything was working fine before we disconnected. This case had dragged on from the 17th to the 26th, and I'm so glad Alex stepped in to help!####$$##%POSITIVE
It is well worth the money too! A tutor would cost the same for only 1 hour of tutoring!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Andrew Clem And! Because our current system works so well, right?####$$##%POSITIVE
Wanderlust and travel. Love of cultures. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thnks Rain RSS!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
To add to the confusion...I just opened up my RS app on my second computer, and the green ticks are all in the right place on that.  However, on my laptop, they are still missing...####$$##%NEGATIVE
That worked, thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Sounds great! is that the 3month one for £149?####$$##%POSITIVE
That is a good deal because I think it is $150 a year to add studio after your 3 months expire. Not sure but close to that.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Judy,  I am glad to hear of your positive experiences with Rosetta Studio! You might enjoy one of Rosetta Stone's TOTALe Social webinars where you can learn more about the TOTALe product, including Studio, and how to make the most out of your experience. You can find the TOTALe Social schedule at the Rosetta Stone Success Central homepage at http://success.rosettastone.com  Best of luck on your language-learning journey!  Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
More kudos for anne (and all the french studio coaches for that matter) had a studio with anne.  They keep it fresh and fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Anne, she is really helpful and motivating. I really enjoy my sessions with her.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I think it is. And, as any of these programs, immersion is the key. In fact, as I am nearing the end of Level 3, I am feeling that I have outgrown my "classroom" time and I need to be able to speak the language in daily use.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi William,  Congratulations on your accomplishments within the Rosetta Stone Portuguese (Brazil) program! Are you a TOTALe customer with an active online access subscription? If so, Rosetta Studio sessions are a great way to practice conversation and further improve your language skills!####$$##%POSITIVE
Aaron: Yes, I do two Studio sessions for each unit I complete; thank for the reminder, though. Rachel: Thank you; and thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement!####$$##%POSITIVE
Great stories, I love hearing and reading them. And, although you must have a Rosetta World (on-line) subscription to see them, they show up locally in your Rosetta Stone application.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Tiffany,  It is great that you would like to learn a new language! Currently Rosetta Stone is offering Spanish as an online subscription for just $20.00 a month so you get the most of your money! For more information visit http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-spanish?cid=sm-fb or reach out to one of the wonderful Rosetta Stone Customer Success agents on this Facebook page.  Best of luck on your language learning journey!  Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
Any luck with finding the ionline subscription tiffany? i can't see it :/####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, I appreciate it!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Excellent idea!  Also, RS, you've got to add some cultural tips while you're at it!! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
If I unplug my headset I have no sound at all unless I reboot. I'm on Windows running Vista.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The same thing happens to us!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm simply removing my headset from my USB port like I do my other headphones. I did a session tonight and disconnected. I went to the place you are talking about but when I pull up the playback devices the only device it's showing is my main speakers. I wonder if I should try leaving the headset plugged in and manually switching to my speakers...?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well, it's Rosetta Stone course... it's good!!  Downside is for anyone beginning from the very beginning and trying to get through levels 1-5, one year is not enough time!!!!!!!!!  Buy the software so you have it forever!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Do it and find out! Once you start, you won't stop..... hopefully.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, if you don't know any Italian and you want/need to learn, RS is great!  Have you not checked out the demo or gone to a kiosk to have them show you in details!?!?  The entire 5 level program is definitely better than the "required" language learning of a university.  Plus, the size and recognition of the company says a lot for its actual success in developing a program for ANYONE to learn a new language from the very beginning to close to the end!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yea huh, Thanks for the info, I gotta check more into it.####$$##%POSITIVE
With Rosetta Stone, I definitely learned that "you get what you pay for".  all the free and cheap stuff out there just doesn't come close, doesn't get you where you want to be with a language and where you KNOW you can get. they just kind of leave off and leave you hanging.  There is soooo much packed into not only RS Course but the stories in RWorld and games.... addicting... ok I need to hop into one of my languages! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Jenny! I'm using Rosetta Stone to learn Hebrew so I think I can relate. The writing and reading portions are definitely the most challenging with the symbols being SO unfamiliar! I don't know what products are out there for Arabic, but for Hebrew I bought a Hebrew-English dictionary (Webster's makes one that is transliterated which is very helpful for a new learner!). I am so glad I have it for many reasons. I also bought Hebrew for Dummies, which is a really nice supplement. It seems to have an explanation every time there's something I'm not quite getting. Also, it has alphabet charts and stuff like that that help with the reading/writing. Online I was also able to find several free charts and resources for the alphabet. Hope this is helpful. Maybe there are a few resources out there for Arabic that will help you along. I haven't regretted buying them at all and have used them much more than I thought I would. Good luck! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, and one more thing, there is a BlackBerry app (and I'm sure an app of some sort for all the other kinds of phones) called FancyTran that translates English into Hebrew, Arabic and tons of other languages. I use it when I get stuck to figure out how to write the words. It is super helpful and easy to use. And free!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much for your advice :) I have Arabic for dummies too, I'll look out for the phone app. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Also parts of the reading lesson where you say the phrases is difficult, I can say it over and over and he says I haven't got it right when I have but then when I say something which I know is wrong it says it's correct. Is this a known error as well??####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Rebecca,  I am sorry to hear that you are confused and hope I can help clarify any concerns. I have dealt extensively with Rosetta Stone products in various instances and I can assure you that it is a phenomenal solution and one that I p...ersonally believe is the best on the market. I have worked with Rosetta Stone implementations in schools for example, and have seen the difference it makes in students' language proficiency. I have also seen the difference it has made with various individual users to whom I recommended the product. Especially now with Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe, you are not just getting a simple piece of language-learning software. TOTALe allows you to learn the language, while also being nurtured and supported by fellow learners and Rosetta Stone's fantastic Studio Coaches. As I said before, TOTALe is not just a piece of software, it is a supportive online language learning community that you, like many others, will fall in love with. If you have any further questions, I would be more than happy to help. You can also feel free to reach out to members of the Rosetta Stone Customer Success Team who often monitor this page. They are also a wonderful resource you get with Rosetta Stone, and they support you throughout your language-learning journey and make you feel like a name, not a number.  Best of luck, Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
You are very welcome. Also, I think you made a good call not going with the Homeschool edition. The TOTALe experience is one you will not regret. On another note, if you do go through with purchasing TOTALe, I would suggest the following. Every few days Rosetta Stone has a TOTALe Social webinar. These webinars allow you to learn about TOTALe and make the most of your experience with the product. There is also a live Q & A at the end where you can get your questions answered live by the host of the webinar. Usually the webinars are hosted by Christine Durakis or Michael Withrow, two of Rosetta Stone's finest employees. Sometimes, the Sr. VP of Customer Success himself, Jay Topper, is a part of them. All in all, TOTALe Social webinars are yet another great part of the Rosetta Stone experience. You can find information about the next TOTALe Social webinar at http://success.rosettastone.com  Best of luck on your language-learning journey!  Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
ty so much, very helpful  advice!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with almost everything said in the article...the example he gave about the shirt was exactly how I felt, frustrated at not knowing if I was guessing at the shirt/shirt color/shirt design/etc. The immersion method was very frustrating to me, and I did get bored of repeating the same simple phrases...and it hasn't led me to fluency, and I have had to go to other sources (including an instructor led class). That being said, I think some people (like myself) are simply not bilingual. After all 5 levels of RS German, I still don't think in German... I may never be able to think in a foreign language, but if I can get enough phrases to travel and ask for things, I'm OK with that. I need to learn some languages for my travels, so I purchased RS Italian...but I now know exactly what I'll get out of it: the ability to learn some vocabulary and to be able to make basic requests. It's not going to make me fluent. Obviously, my experience is different than many others on here, who pick up languages much easier than I have, but I think it's important to hear experiences from people like me. People learn differently.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Aaron! Thanks for letting me know..... I'll be there on 03/14!  It's my son's 25th birthday, so it is definitely going to be an awesome day!####$$##%POSITIVE
Jamieee! You are cute for liking this!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hmmm... what are the author's qualifications as an expert on teaching language?  I've been using Rosetta Stone for a year now with excellent results. I'll be happy to refute all six of the author's "problems" for anyone considering purchasing Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
What an idiot, has anyone noticed all the bad reviews are people who didn't get past the first unit of the first level, they were too lazy to read the info about how the method used is immersion or they're trying to sell their own crap. In my opinion RS is great for independent learners who know how to use other resources as well, if you need to be spoon fed the answers and have EVERYTHING explained to you then maybe you should go back to school with your juicebox and backpack.####$$##%POSITIVE
ummm NOW Im really confused, I was ready to either purchase the 1-5 latin american spanish set, the latin america home school set, or try the $20 a month online programs and now Im NOT sure what I should do!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hi Reecca Hi have Spanish set 1-5 CDs. You also get 3 month online totals with it  I also tried different books and materials and got nowhere I couldn't say a single thing I got RS and I'm on disk 3 unit 1 lesson 3   5 disks  4 units per disk 4 lessons per unit   I was talkin to myself the other day in Spanish and its only thought the RS that I'm able to do it that's are words I can't say but in my conversations with myself I replace any words I dont know with English and I am suppressed at when I fuse a word I have not said in a while that I still get it. My issue at the moment is confidence in speaking aloud to other people. I read some of the books I purchased and they are now making sense it is strange that linking at pictures and listening or reading makes u learn the language if you have struggled before then try RS don't let any review make or break your deduction only dl it because you want to learn a language everybody learns differently. With RS Ther e is a good money back offer to sen it back after I think 3-6 months so u will soon know if it's right in that time for you. I have ha this for 2 months and I know I'm keeping it cos I can now speak and read Spanish and am proud of what I've learned. Make your decision for you not from others reviews you wouldn't buy any other product Ailey cos someone Elise liked it or not buy something Ailey cos someone didn't like it or liked something else more it's all down to what u want and how you learn. If you do go for it I bet in a month you are praising the product.   Hope this helps ####$$##%POSITIVE

Hi Mykle,  I am sorry to hear of your dissatisfaction with Rosetta Stone. While it is true that, generally speaking, everyone learns differently, everyone learned their first language the same way, with Immersion. Immersion is not necessari...ly easy, but it requires a lot of active brain function. In fact, it has been shown that learning a new language builds new neural pathways in the brain, and helps to increase brain function. I can definitely understand your concerns however. It is true that different learners learn at different speeds. If you have discovered that you are a slower learner, I would recommend doing more Studio Sessions and Rosetta World activities. Also, feel free to contact the Rosetta Stone Concierge Services at (866) 834-6115, Option 5. I am sure that they would be more than happy to assist you with developing a plan to succeed and make the most out of your language-learning experience. I would also recommend the TOTALe Social webinars that I mentioned in my previous comment.  Best of luck on your language-learning journey!  Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
Sitting behind a computer isn't natural####$$##%NEGATIVE
Aaron - I see you're a big RS fan, and that's nice...but your experience doesn't change, or have any greater weight of importance, over another users experience.  To clarify, I'm not dissatisfied with the product - I feel the product has benefits and i've learned lots of vocabulary from RS. My experience is that RS isn't the be-all-end-all to language learning. When someone tells me I learned my first language from immersion, it's really oversimplifying things. I had parents, siblings and aunts/uncles who taught me words, in context, in 24-hour real life situations.  They didn't make me guess when I used the wrong word, they corrected me (unlike RS which leaves you hanging to guess again).  They corrected my grammar, so once I learned things like pronouns, like She and Her, they corrected me when I said things like  "Her likes it" instead of "She likes it".  Studio sessions are enjoyable and helpful, but it's nowhere near what's needed to become fluent.  Adult learners like myself need to be able to ask questions, to understand why...and sometimes what RS gives is just not enough.  I've taken German classes before RS, then RS, and now an instructor-led class after RS.  AFter two years and thousands of dollars, I'm nowhere near fluent...and that's OK.  I've adjusted my expectations about languages.  Some of us just aren't bilingual, and that's OK.####$$##%NEGATIVE

My son is going to order the homeschool set for the kids, they live in Texas...so now I am trying to decide if I should order the Latin America 1-5 set or go with the $20 monthly program... I need to learn spanish ASAP for a job, I am not working at the present time, I was in a car accident nov. 2009 and I am recieving workers comp. Is there a payment paln for the total set? and how does it differ from the $20 monthly program? I would like to get started asap so that I will be able to speak spanish fluently before I return to work, I know that a second language, especially spanish will make it easier fot me to get a better job...in fact I have been offered a position at a wonderful company, if I can learn to speak spanish fluently so that I can answer phones and provide customer service as well as communicate with employees who do not speak english......I didnt know if the payment plans were only for the homeschool version ? thank you so much  for your help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rebecca,  For you, I would recommend TOTALe because of the support it provides you with Rosetta Studio and Rosetta World, so you can practice and have a more enjoyable experience. Currently, Rosetta Stone is only offering Spanish (Latin America) as an Online Subscription for $20 per month online. By the way, TOTALe is either the Box-set or the Online Subscription. The online subscription gives you full TOTALe Online Access for the length of the subscription. When you buy the box, you have access to Rosetta Course (the main learning component) for life, and you get 3 free months of access to the other components of TOTALe such as Rosetta Studio and Rosetta World. After the 3 months are up, you can buy more months of online access for different pricing schemes depending on how many months you buy at a time. You can get a 5-payment plan, along with a 6 month Money Back Guarantee by purchasing from an Official Rosetta Stone Kiosk location near you. Otherwise, you can get the online subscription on http://www.rosettastone.com/wt-tosub/learn-spanish?cid=sm-fb. Personally, I would recommend the Online Subscription, because you get all the parts of TOTALe included for the whole duration of your subscription.  Best of luck, Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
wow ...TY so much, decision made.!! Im going for the TOTALe...I appreciate all your help, and for answering all my questions so quickly!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rebecca,  You are most welcome. I am glad that I was able to help you make the right decision and join the Rosetta Stone Community.  Best of luck learning your new language!  Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
Great post..thx####$$##%POSITIVE
And I know there is nothing worse than speaking a different language with a native speaker and having them correct you at every point.  It has happened to me here in Buenos Aires...fortunately not very often.  My professors at school are great about letting you express yourself during conversation and later, in the grammar section, going back over stuff that needs improvement.####$$##%NEGATIVE
James...I am glad that you agree.  I speak Spanish everyday with natives here in the US, globally via Skype, watch television, listen talk radio in my languages everyday!  You can never know every accent, idiom, sland in a language.  Non-native english speakers here in America would have a problem adjusting to Great Britian with the following terms/expressions:####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes, i want to study italian####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Joey. I will continue. The good thing is her next language is going to be German which is my next language also. It happens to be the language I put on hold so we could work on Spanish. Now if only I can get her interested in Asian languages such Japanese & Korean. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I love doing my Spanish course too!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just finished one a few minutes ago and my next one is next Tuesday. I would love to do them more often but they do fill up quickly.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't be discouraged!  The other learners may be on a higher level of the program and be taking that session for review.  Or maybe they have previous experience with the language.  Try taking each session several times. The more you practice the better you will get!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yea Linda, I had that happen to me twice - and then I noticed that the lady who was speaking French like a native was about 3 levels ahead of me :P (I went from discouraged to really excited, knowing that I'd be like that one day :P) Just keep practicing and don't get discouraged by more advanced speakers - we all move at our own pace :)####$$##%POSITIVE

There is no misunderstanding. I shouldn't have to pay to talk to technical support about installing a program that I already spent good money on, period.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Go ahead! You will love it! I promise!####$$##%POSITIVE
I would but I cant buy it for two reasons: I dont work and no one in my family would spend $500-600 on this box. I can just take a class in my college.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Try the review and adaptive recall lessons, this works for me! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
It is, I stared attending a french conversation group in level 1 after finishing unit 2...survived and had fun####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been through all that and working with a so-called "Success team member" for over 2 weeks and nothing, zip, nada.  I still get error messages.  I installed it on my desktop, but I travel for work, so I tried to install it on my laptop. No luck.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Now I can't even run the damned thing on my destop.  I've had it.  I want my money back!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Finally, after  30 minute wait on the telephone, someone helped me and go it resolved.  A full MONTH after I purchased the program.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the encouragement! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Same here Tim. I'm doing Japanese also. I have played games with a few people but usually I don't sign on when other people are on.  I love the studio portion. I love being able to practice it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much tracie, I'm excited to see the next japanese game night is on a saturday will definitly be there ^.^ . :D####$$##%POSITIVE
by advertising with Rush Limbaugh you are choosing political sides####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am in total agreement and am waiting for an answer from Rosetta Stone as to it's sponsorship of O'Reilly.  There is now a major political push to boycott any sponsor of O'Reilly and Limbaugh.####$$##%NEGATIVE
These comments are focused on your company, who your customers are & who you support via your advertising.  I have, by my enthusiasm do RS sold many versions of your products.  I will no longer express this enthusiasm until RS ceases supporting O'Reilly, hence Limbaugh.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Vielen Dank!  Das ist sehr hilfreich!####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning about Success.RosettaStone.com and the Learner Success Plan. ####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a different method from my experience - it's all about listening and rote memorization. Rosetta Stone checks your pronunciation, teaches you to write in the language, and has the Studio Sessions which help you feel more comfortable using the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Jens, they are very different. Pimsleur is bar far the best audio program for leaning a language that I have found. However Rosetta Stone takes it to a whole other level. If you really want to learn a language Rosetta is definitely the way to go.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks and its not just speech recognition any time I speek and I dont think its the mic becuse Ive used outher mics and its the same thing. thanks for the artical btw####$$##%NEGATIVE
yeah mic setup is fine its just that when ever I say a ward right it dosent hear it####$$##%NEGATIVE
fixed it thank guys####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, I honestly just started a few days ago.. I told my boss I really wanted to learn it, and he surprised me with it!! I'm taking my time with it so I can allow myself enough time to become comfortable in the early stages, preparing myself for the later ones :).. I really like how Rosetta compares the pictures to the phrases,(I mean, who doesn't love multiple choice) and it gives you visual so it jump starts my photographic memory lol...I also really love the repetitive nature of it, (making it easier) but with that being said, I must say I was a little disappointed b/c initially I was under the impression Rosetta would first teach me how to pronounce the letters/words more thoroughly.. while to the contrary it begins with small words, Avion, chat, chien, etc etc.... They do say the phrases & words, which is great, but if you're pretty clueless (like myself) and don't really know how to read French, or speak the style "ex: how when using Spanish you can roll you're R's and such" then it sounds like you're just trying to mimic the person speaking.. and the person might come off slightly faster then expected. I feel like I am not saying it right because of it, haha.. But, I really do love Rosetta, and have heard phenomenal things so I'm sticking with it and I look forward to hopefully progressing in the ways of Francais, and mastering the art of Rosetta... :)####$$##%POSITIVE
After a unit or two, the pronunciation of words just becomes intuitive. I'm also studying French and am on Level 4 Unit 2, and I've had multiple French people that I've met say I have a wonderful accent now (which was certainly not the case before Rosetta Stone :P)####$$##%POSITIVE
well that is most certainly reassuring :) thanks Jens!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Second session today and once again ends at 41 minutes. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, but it did not finish at 40 minutes. The trainer ended it at 40 minutes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have taken 4 sessions since I re-signed up and all of them have ended at about 40 minutes. Each time they go to the end slide from a different spot.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They take us to the good bye screen and say good bye. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm learning German.  We all learn in our own ways, so if taking notes helps, then I say go for it!  Good luck on your journey learning Italian!  I think Rosetta Stone is great!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wow that sucks. I guess I'm gonna have to get Thai for Pimsleur then... =\####$$##%NEGATIVE
I loved how I learned even more new vocabulary during the session.  I really can't express how helpful Silke was and really getting me to think and us what I've learned.  It's really surprising just how well you can carry on a conversation even when you're still in level 1.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
A lot of their words are similar to English...having some trouble with some of the verb tenses, though...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Except once again the session ended 10 minutes early. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like her. She's pretty good.  That sucks that yours are ending so early.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yea, I am enjoying the sessions very much but they are all ending early. What I like about Kanako sesei is that she very thorough. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Japanese and I found that yes the Rosetta Stone will teach you how to speak and read the language but I was having a harder time comparing their sentence structure to our own when there is no direct explanation. So I bought a basic "Learn Japanese" type of book at the book store to understand the mechanic's of it and now I understand the language much better and can use the RS program alot better.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm starting French and I took 2years in highschool my sister speeks a little and is taking it at college so I'm hoping she can help if I have too many questions. Thanks for all the support good luck!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely set aside a time every day to work on it.  I am learning German and have set aside about a half hour, although some days it turns out that I have spend an hour.  And it is work, but fun work.  And you will be amazed on how much you absorb.  And it's fun and addicting!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've bought Italian, Portuguese, Latin, Japanese and Spanish for my fiance. Im already a spanish interpreter. I've also started to learn Farsi, Arabic, and Sign Language. I want to learn Mandarin, Russia, German, Tagalog, Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish Sign Language. I plan on buying each language from Rosetta Stone to perfect each language. Is there a way I can find a job with Rosetta stone since interpreting and learning languages is my hobbie?####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome quote. I am so glad I can read that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to learn it and then my children to learn it so I can help them I love it at the moment.####$$##%POSITIVE
I went through the process and now I am being prompted to set up as a new learner. I am not a new learner and I already finished level 1 and in the process of completing level 2.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got it sorted out b Rosetta support online. thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Silke is great!####$$##%POSITIVE
LOL That was a good comparison.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, it's amazing... if I show my Mom and Aunt that I'm learning Japanese from the demo, they would probably pay for the full version. Looks like they've missed out on a sale.####$$##%POSITIVE
that was last thursday and still havent recieved it :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
calling customer service is a 20-30 minute ordeal....EVERY time Ive called its said estimated hold time 8 minutes and turned into WAY longer....wondering ( should I even KEEP it when it is delivreed? )####$$##%NEGATIVE
You should definitely keep it. The program is really worth it. Both in money and the pain you are going through to get it. You will not regret it. Though I would ask for a refund of your two day shipping.####$$##%POSITIVE
ty but they have already told me its coming today! I have sat and wasted 2 days when I could have purchased @ the kiosk location, however the operator @ Rosetta Stone I 1st spoke with said I would get better customer service and a better deal buying it directly from the comp., NOW I have concerns about the hold time and how hard it is to reach someone over the phone with questions.... Im not very good with the computer, or electronics in general ( my 8 year old grand-daughter set up my cell phone for me) and Im wondering if Im even going to be able to use the program ...lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you BUT theres really nothing you can do! They already agreed to refund me the extra $15.95 I paid for 2 day shipping...which was nice BUT totally not the point, I would have gladly paid an extra $100 if I could have recieved  it in the 2 days I was promised or even overnight....ALSO heres a tip for Rosetta Stone...If you ship priority mail and use the US postal service, NOT only is it cheaper but they deliver on saturdays and YOU will get your package ON time....I have sent my grandkids near dallas texas hundreds of packages, envelopes, HUGE boxes full of items, and its never taken more than 2-3 days from baton rouge La or even from here in Orange Beach, Alabama where I am this week! And I do not like sending and waiting for  a response in an email, I like speaking to a REAL person on the phone when I have a problem, but thank you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ive been reading some of the other concerns and comments from customers and will I have to pay EVERY year to renew after already spending so much??? and Im still HOME sitting, WAITING on UPS!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your response :)####$$##%POSITIVE
According to what I saw, they don't upgrade V2 anymore. It's okay though, I bought it used and it was probably "less than legal" anyway.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't wait to be on level 4 or even finish RS so I can chat away to my Spanish and Mexican friends! Well done Donald!####$$##%POSITIVE
You are going to love it!  I found that with RS Italian, level two built upon level one, so there were no strange or scary surprises, and it was just as easy as fun as level one. :)  Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks guys! I'm sure I will be OK, just have to work hard I guess! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Fine! Actually I think a little break now and then does you good! I did still use the audio companion and iPhone app so that's probably why I was ok! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Tracie! Trying to learn Spanish and maintain/improve my French at the same time has its own challenges but I love it! It's a hobby!####$$##%POSITIVE
Activation code won't work! I get to last digit and it will not accept it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I cannot wait until my Japanese session tomorrow. I haven't scheduled one  in awhile. I'll be doing level 3 unit 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
Adrianna, I would say it is the fastest way to learn a language besides living there.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Kirtus.  RS definitely needs to make a level 4 and a 5. 3 levels is just not enough.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well, the studio sessions are fun. I enjoy the reinforcement from them. But I thoroughly enjoy reading and especially listening to the short stories. As a result, I started looking for public radio programs in French or news items in French just to listen for reinforcement as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Kirtus, I have the online version, per Tracie, I can't have another learner; however Tracie, it does state I can have another learner??####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. It will be exciting. As she is from Ukraine, I plan on taking  my future family there at least once a year over their Christmas in January. It would be cool to know enough Russian for my first meeting with her family. Surprise them. I will post my updates here if I don't forget.   I once had a "less than legal" copy a couple years ago before demos were available. I learned and retained so much of it. So, when I noticed the TOTALe version with more levels, I had to get it.   I have no doubt it will be $500 well spent.   My girlfriend is advanced in English, and I plan to get this for her to fine tune her understanding. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. I know that I get the online stuff free for three months, but I doubt I'd use it. Always working and online access can be spotty. However, I already have my native Russian speaker I talk to on the phone two to three times a month. We can work on it together.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I am able to have conversation now in Spanish. I however got two more levels in Spanish to learn. 4 and 5.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well that sucks...its not like it is an old phone...Come Atrix users, let get them to add our phone!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had the same problem in Spanish today. It was good for the first ten minutes and then another person signed in and I kept hearing echoes. I could barely tell what the teacher was saying. Our instructor had to leave for a little while then return. I usually have good sessions but not today unfortunately.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Our instructor left the session too, and the echo stopped...the other participant  and I could easily hear each other. The instructor returns and so did the echo...that tells me the problem was on the instructors line, not mine.  I relayed this to tech support, but they kept pinging me asking me more questions, test my speed, check my volume settings (all of which were not the problem).####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've had the same problem during my last 2 sessions. The first time I had this problem tech support made me log out and restart my browser. I know the echo wasn't me b/c they were also breathing heavy in their mic. I agree with you tho, it's very frustrating trying to schedule sessions since there never seem to be any during the present week. They need to add more sessions.  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Jay.  It's definitely appreciated. I always wear the headset.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a great way to start!####$$##%POSITIVE
Going very well, thank you for asking. Or should I say: Muy bien!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! I rebooted my PC and it worked fine. No problems at all! Viviana is a great coach! So happy and bubbly and patient! Send her my appreciation!.....To be honest all your coaches are good. I want to be a British English coach! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Używam programu Rosetty Stone do nauki języka polskiego i jest świetny!####$$##%POSITIVE
Dziękuję bardzo####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, that could be true on the technical difficulties, however, there weren't that many people around for Game Night, I think six and after being put on holdwith those two, there were only 2, when I looked again.  OH, Well, there is always next time....####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like getting to repeat the words into my UBS headset. So far, I have passed every thing with a 90-above. :) yay!####$$##%POSITIVE
There's also http://www.discount-rosettastone-store.com/  They advertise right on Facebook.####$$##%NEGATIVE
First, I have to chase them all the time, join levels below, levels above just so i can have some practice, finally i get one at the time i can attend at the level i am, and i cannot attend it anyway, because i do not know who just removed me from it####$$##%NEGATIVE
And there is no available sessions at level 3 unit 2 until next Saturday####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, I never got even a chance to get to the class to start working on the issue, the mic was failing when you go thru the steps to logon to the session, and then i have disconnected mic , reconnected mic, restarted the RS, and could not see the session available to join anymore####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is very very upsetting, because it so hard to find the appropriate class, then I had to rearrange all my other activities, and did not get anywhere####$$##%NEGATIVE
You really have to do something about this issue. it is not the first time that I am complaining about studio availability for Spanish Spain####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please understand, this is not about my mic issue, and not even about deleted session issue anymore. It is all about your customer expectations and RS delivery. Yes, I would be a little upset, if a technical issue like not working mic, or accidental removal from a session happens once in a while. The problem is that I have ben chasing these sessions for many weeks, and had to rearrange my schedule to finally attend one, and then after not be able to attend because of a technical issue, and knowing that I will not be able to attend for another week or may be even longer, causes all these emotions. Please, escalate this as the scheduling issue, that what we have to sort out. Thank you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Knowing how the entire program works as well as the detail of what I actually purchased etc was great.  A good walk around the site was helpful and informative as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is by far the best language program out there!!! Please keep up the excellent work. Kudos for you all the way!####$$##%POSITIVE
The new Rosetta Stone course is a great advancement.   I now hardly ever get bored!!!   To me, a dictionary is not an absolute necessity, but a help.   Also it is good to beable to use a dictionary in the languages of your choice.####$$##%POSITIVE
BTW, one small technical question.  In this session, the "Attend" button didn't appear until the session had started.  I recall that in the past it showed a few minutes before so that I could test my microphone.  Was there a glitch tonight?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think the same way Joseph, it gets kind of hard for me at times even though I am learning a romance language, I cant even imagine how it must be to learn a language like Chinese. I also understand RS way of teaching a language, but at the same time I believe not everyone can learn like that and RS needs to work on the grammar aspect of the language as well. I do like RS but in my opinion its not as good as how they promote it on TV. Do you have any other resources like books, or do you listen to Chinese radio? I also know that you just cant rely on RS, you have to have other sources to learn as well. Somedays I feel unmotivated as well and get frustrated at times, but I still keep going. I hope this helped you a bit.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tend to enjoy the Rosetta Stone method.  However, I researched the product and did a demo of the language I'm studying, so I knew what to expect going into it.  If I have trouble I repeat the lessons.  To aid in the immersion style of learning, which is what Rosetta Stone uses, I have downloaded an app on my iPad to watch foreign TV stations, I watch foreign movies on Netflix, search for popular US TV shows dubbed in foreign languages on YouTube, etc. I find these things helpful in the learning process.  I wish you luck in your journey learning Chinese!####$$##%POSITIVE
I do much of what Amber does. I use Netflix for foreign movies and Youtube for different shows and movies.  I like RS and I started with Japanese. But I did have a lot of exposure to that language before I got RS.####$$##%POSITIVE
Your experience is much like mine was with German. Incredibly frustrating at times...and yes, it does continue as the program goes on...but keep going (even if you have to use Google translate).  For some people, it clicks at some point and becomes more enjoyable and less frustrating (it didn't get less frustrating for me...but I completed all 5 levels and am glad I did).####$$##%NEGATIVE
I found that Mandarin and the rosetta stone method don't go very well together.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I feel that way about Arabic.  It's why I haven't learned it yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
However, there needs to be a way for a student to get the translation in their mother tongue, not just assume that the student really understands the term after repeating it. for example, in chinese, colors are simple like you say. But for clothing, they seem to require helping words in front of the noun, at least, that's what I think. their grammar section as they call it is pretty weak in my opinion. I can't wait till they get to past tenses to see how they cover that. Then they are starting with prepositions, at least, I think they are. Again - why should I be uncertain that the word might be something. why can't they localize it so I can easily check. I've takenn to opening google translate to try to figure this out - that's not a good sign for the usability of RS imho.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm raising the BS flag on the last post from Rosetta Stone.  The lack of translation is useless if you can't figure out what the picture is telling you.  Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it makes no sense.  The frustration level was astounding at times.  It would get me so upset, I would have to walk away for a few days before trying again.  After that happened a couple of times, I started using google translate (not for everything, but only if I was not figuring something out), and then I found I wasn't getting frustrated anymore and actually was enjoying it a bit.  They say you learn the language from RS like you learned your first language...but they seem to forget that children had parents who helped them learn when things weren't making sense.  The lack of that support person to help when something wasn't clicking was really frustrating to me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Stuart: I'm currently in the United States military and I put in a request to get stationed in Japan. If accepted then I will be stationed in Japan for 2 years. I also plan on going to a university in Japan after I get out of the military. I found a school there that accepts the GI Bill. So, I will be doing my studies in Japan. Tara: I listen to a lot of Japanese music. Have fun learning more Japanese with Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks very much--I appreciate the info and will definitely follow up.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have tried to play, however always get kicked out of the game so I am going to try the game night in french on Monday####$$##%NEGATIVE
That I am speaking with a native speaker.  Most have been very kind to my very poor french.  Sure wish my brain picked up the language faster.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am having trouble with the games.  I keep getting kicked out of the game.####$$##%NEGATIVE
3-ways.  1 - says I have a weak connection (u-verse), 2 - says the person has left, 3 - I flash back to my RS game page.  When that happens I contact the person who was gaming with me and tell them I am sorry, I got kicked out.  They either ask me back to play again only to have same problem.  I will try todays game nite, after that if unable to play, I will stick to the single games.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good luck. I'm currently working on Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just love the challenge and I think learning a new language helps us to understand and respect other cultures :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much for your help. Problem was solved. Good Luck####$$##%POSITIVE
If you complete all 5 levels you should be conversational in the language. If you back up your RS course with other sources like TV, films, books etc then you will be even better. They problem with no buying all 5 levels is that after level 3 you will want more! And be kicking yourself that you didn't buy all 5! You will be hooked! Good luck! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
you must buy it, totally worthy####$$##%POSITIVE
Agreed!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rachel! it's been such a long time with it first my uncle was studying it then he recommended it me i'm now at college studying international business i'm from mexico and i'm taking classes of Italian in fact i just ordered Rosetta Stone Italian to mix it with my classes so i can take an advantage all over the class and next semester i'll take German Classes to mix it with this wonderful Rosetta Stone German! you have been recommended by me to teachers and classmates :D they saw your webpage and they agreed with all!, Greetings Rachel :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I was nervous at first, but it wore off because she was so helpful and made sure i understood. It was just an overall great learning experience, I can't wait to have my next studio session!####$$##%POSITIVE
You may get a faster answer if you call customer service####$$##%POSITIVE
I am having the same problem with Spanish...sometimes I get it, sometimes I'm not sure, and somtimes I don't get the meaning at all!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Vielen Dank Thomas for another great session!####$$##%POSITIVE
My advice to new learners is...don't be afraid of Studio sessions!  The coaches are so kind and patient and really make the learning experience fun.  Play some games prior to your session as a warm up and then jump in...it's a blast!####$$##%POSITIVE
P.S. Not only am I REALLY learning it, but I'm addicted to learning more of it all the time.####$$##%POSITIVE
I take it no Greek demo though?####$$##%NEGATIVE
oh i like it a lot! you actually remember words pretty quickly, i think my favorite word so far is devochika (girl) just for the way it sounds, haha####$$##%POSITIVE
i just got mine russian about a month ago its so much fun!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the welcome :) Tracie: Got your e-mail but tonights going to be a bit hectic for me. I'll try to get a response to it to you sometime in the morning. After downloading and reading the users manual my problem with finding the exit might be that I haven't set up the online stuff yet. If I remember correctly, clicking on the door started up my web browser and then it complained that I didn't set up online yet. I'll set that up a bit later and see if that gives me the right exit :) I already know most of the Hiragana, some of the Katakana (things like so, shi, tsu, no, and n still give me quite a few problems), and a couple kanji (mostly numbers and direction from playing mahjong :) ). But recognizing and reading are different things. Back to baby steps :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much! Shanice has already contacted me and we are working through my issues. I must say that RosettaStone's customer service is excellent, very courteous, and responsive- commendable!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am using OSX 10.7.3 and it works fine.  When I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion, however, I did get an error on startup.  I contacted support and a technician reinstalled RS for me.  No problems since then.####$$##%POSITIVE
JIM - WAS THIS RS SUPPORT OR APPLE SUPPORT? RS has not been very much help so far. Tried my wife's laptop too, purchased w/Lyon and it won't load there either.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Terry--it was RS support, by phone.  The tech, with my permission, took over my computer and reinstalled the program.  It's worked fine since.  I'm going to check with RS first later in  the year before deciding whether to upgrade to Mountain Lion when it comes out.####$$##%POSITIVE
Muy bien! Yo quiero aprender Frances.####$$##%POSITIVE
Estoy seguro de que puede, sin mencionar otros programas de aprendizaje de idiomas Rosetta Stone es la mejor que he intentado####$$##%POSITIVE
Aileen, si tienes el programa del Rosetta es fantástico!!! Yo estoy aprendiendo francés y estoy feliz. Ayuda mucho a mejorar no sólo la construcción de las frases, tener retentiva del idioma sino también en la pronunciación que nos da tan duro.####$$##%POSITIVE
I want to travel to Italy next year and find family. My Grand-mother came here to the US in 1907 but I think we still have family there.....LOVE ROSETTA STONE.... My average is about 92% but I am still having trouble writing and structuring the sentences....Not confident to go into the chat yet,lol....####$$##%POSITIVE
Windows 7  and I could not get to the  a chat session or a place I could send questions and I really got tired of being put on hold!####$$##%NEGATIVE
The problems I had with installing were it kept wanting to update and it did it several times and then I think my CD/DVD had to be reloaded  as it disappeared.   Reinstalled the drivers and still was asked to update again.  Then nothing when I wnet to language level it went back to update again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So I bought the program over a month again and when I have days off work and can deal with it.  I try until I get fustrated I have checked Firewalls, Security etc. to see if that was the trouble it was not.####$$##%NEGATIVE
learning the words by picture representation and not the english equivalents.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, but when I click on the free demo link and try to open the file that was downloaded I get a message that says unknown file type, and then asks what program I want to use to open it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, I'm using a PC.  I was using Widonws Explorer on my business laptop at work, which is running Windows 7, when I had the problem stated above.  I then clicked the "Try the Free Demo" on my home PC, which is running Windowx XP and recieved a dialog box that gave me a File Download Security warning and said it was an unknown file type.  I downl loaded the files and it wouldn't run.  I then tried again on my Home PC, but this time I tried using Mozilla Firefox.  I receive a message that sayes What should Firefox do with this file "Open" or "Save Files" .  I've tried opening but you have to select an applicaiton to run it.  What type of files is being downloaded and what application do I need to run it?####$$##%NEGATIVE
It crashes over and over####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was great as always!  Thomas makes the sessions fun.  Now I'm joining in a lower level session at the last minute for review since there's a spot left just for more practice and review.  Ich liebe die deutsche Sprache!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had Gloria for my second session tonight and she made it very fun and we learned lots of new words!####$$##%POSITIVE
I did not know that those course content exsisted!!!  Mucho Gracias!!  that is sooooo going to help me!!####$$##%POSITIVE
yep.  I do each level studio session several times.  I learn something new almost every time!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Liz!!  I will sched another one even tho I have moved on to Unit 2...The hard copies of the course content is really going to help when I do not have access to the online course...like at work!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Studio is a live online lesson with a native speaker of the language you are learning.  It is pretty cool!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Your customer support team have already been trying to help out thanks but with no sessions between 9am and 1pm GMT it doesnt make learning as easy as it supposed to be :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have a very Precious Lady Friend in Germany. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
English is my 1st language and I would like to speak another, Spanish especially, I'm sure many more people would learn another language if they could afford to####$$##%NEGATIVE
I chose Hindi because I love anything to do with India and my motivation is that I want to live there one day :)####$$##%POSITIVE
why dont you sell thai anymore? just wondering. not enough units sold?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wish I could!  Japanese is soooo hard!####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's great, thank you :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Nope, dont have money atm to buy any of the products unfortunately :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, guys :) Oh, I'm learning them two at a time, some days Latin and Japanese, somedays Russian and French, and Celtic along with using the Latin and Celtic rules for writing my own fictional language for my fantasy novel.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the language but I have absolutely no money...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would agree that Thomas is an excellent German coach!  I love attending his Studio sessions!####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't be afraid Suzy!  Just do as Liam suggested and review the material and begin with a Unit 1 Studio session.  Take the sessions as many times as you need to feel comfortable.  You will soon grow to love them!####$$##%POSITIVE
Is that a no then?####$$##%NEGATIVE

I completed three rosetta stone levels before i moved here.  It enabled me to start waitressing after two months of living in the capital!####$$##%POSITIVE
No problem! Received, thanks very much :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you. I have submitted a request x####$$##%POSITIVE
I just would like to know why I didn't get the express delivery I was promised and why it was sent on a standard service?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ordered it first thing Tuesday morning and still waiting..... So much for express delivery being 1-2 days......####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Adam!####$$##%POSITIVE
id love to learn a language but its way too expensive!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok thank you x####$$##%POSITIVE
and according to a native speaker some of the words are incorrect anyway####$$##%NEGATIVE
no.####$$##%NEGATIVE
DO I really HAVE to explain myself?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wish I was learning with Rosetta Stone, it would be so much easier !!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thankyou that was very helpful so could Scottish Gaelic be offered by Rosetta ?####$$##%POSITIVE
I am Lesson 1. Unit 3. After Spanish, I am going to study French then Italian.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. It is after 8p.m. and I have not heard anything yet. Your live chat assistant on Friday also promised I would be contacted. I further requested a transcript of my discussion with him by e-mail, which I have not received either.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Christy  - those are not the issue. The keys on the keyboard that provide the suffixes etc. are actually blank. This was not the case before and happened only last week (incidentally the day after I downloaded Adobe Air as suggested in the live chat). I cannot type them in with the actual keyboard either. Live chat could not help me or understand what the issue is and I can't seem to call your helpline at a time when we are both free. I will try again, but have in the mean time given up on the writing exercises. I will use pen & paper for those and hope I do it correctly.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi - the support is struggling to understand the problem as well. I am thinking of uninstalling the whole RS software and re-installing it. Will I preserve all the work I have done if I do that? I forgot to ask them. thank you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That number is not in service...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Jilon...do not be discouraged, as this was your first Studio session, right?  Now you know what to expect.  Just review the material, play some games to warm up (I enjoy Prospero for warming up) and take the Studio session again.  In fact, take them as often as you need to feel comfortable!  Rosetta Stone does incorporate a lot of the speaking without showing you the words.  If you are on your Rosetta Stone home screen, click where it says "Explore all activities for Unit 1."  Then select the lessons that say "listening" to practice the part you are having difficulty with.  I wish you much luck in your Spanish learning journey!!  Keep us updated with your progress! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
HI Jilon, the reason some of the other people may have performed better than you could be because they have gone through more of the material.  I know when I was learning portuguese.  I went two full levels before I began taking the studio sessions.  By then, I had more of the material under my belt and felt more comfortable interacting online.  But don't be discouraged, as you get through more of the material, you'll become more comfortable and your speech will become more fluid.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think I found something on the succes help site   Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey at least Spanish have rules that are set in stone (pun intended) try learning a language like English which has few rules, changes according to the region you're in, North, South and goes by sound and where the spelling doesn't match the sound!  That hurts my brain.  Having said that, I agree with Rosetta Stone, don't think about the rules, it will eventually all just click into place.  Happy learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
Italiano es un idioma hermoso, estoy aprendiendo espanol.####$$##%POSITIVE
now I doing  levels four this courso is great every day I understending more English in my life.####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't worry at all...the coaches will help and/or correct you and everyone is in the same boat.  If you make a mistake, it helps you and the others to learn from it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Dont worry, I had a studio session a couple days back that didnt go to well, and sometimes I get nervous and I been doing studio sessions for 5 months, I am also learning Spanish so dont worry, once you do the first studio you'll be good.####$$##%POSITIVE
No te preocupes, todo saldrá bien :D también puedes repasar las lecciones que no estés 100% segura.. ¡Buena Suerte!####$$##%POSITIVE
hi, still no one contact me.. and still confuse the time different to contact the support team.  can i uninstall and re install again?####$$##%NEGATIVE
and i tried to follow the support page, but cant find the file. the problem code now is 8112. with 1007 then underneath 20. and is there a support team in australia? i bought the product from rosettastoneaustralia.com store. my headphone was broken when arrived, havent got any respond yet. I still enjoy the lesson, but not the support though####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much for your encouragement. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Be excited!  Studio sessions are a lot of fun!  What language are you learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
I get a little bit nervous before each one I do, even though I've done many. They're excellent fun though and the skilled coaches make them as painless as possible. Enjoy!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much! I'll try to enjoy it as much as possible :) Amber, I'm learning french. What are you guys learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning German :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning German too and have bought Russian too, which I will start soon. Enjoy your session; let us know how you get on!####$$##%POSITIVE
This seems  a great feature. Unfortunately, no-one seems ever online in the Hindi program, even though I am there every day and at different times of the day:-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I have had a couple of Studio sessions and they are great. They put what we are learning through a rote manner into real-life type conversations and I can see the real proof of my progress. I am both mentally exhausted and on an emotional high after the sessions; much like a runner is after a marathon, I suppose- the efforts exerted are rewarded by a great sense of accomplishment!####$$##%POSITIVE
Kinda figured that but it didn't hurt to ask. Any way i have two very different issues. First: Just finished LV1 U1 Lesson2 last night and went to the KB to get the lesson notes (due to my second issue). Although listed as being for Version 3 and 4, they are dated material and out of synch with the current course (at least Japanese is). Is an update in the works for these? Just in the first two lessons of level one I've seen differences in the number of slides, differences in slide content, and also in vocab. They really do need updating. Which kinda leads me to my second issue... Although I went through the entire lesson (and I'm ready to start lesson 3) and scored well, I still don't get the difference between 'motteimasu' (もっています) and 'katteimasu' (かっています). Both seem to mean 'to have' or 'to hold' but the reason to use one over the other is eluding me. It's probably something obvious but I'm just not seeing it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah, I know what you mean. I tried Japanese several years ago but nothing really stuck. A few words and some of the kana but I never 'got' some of the basic things like 'を'. It didn't help that things like that were explained with something that looked more like a doctoral thesis rather than examples of everyday use. After only 2 lessons I 'get' 'を', at least as far as it has been used. A-ha, indeed.  Any way, I took your advise and went back through the slides for ’もっています’ and ’かっています’ and have come down to two possibilities. Unfortunantly, the example that I need isn't there. So I have a suggestion: ’もっています’ has 7 examples while ’かっています’ only has 3. In a different section of the lesson is a picture of a woman holding a baby. Get rid of one of the ’もっています’ examples (suggest the woman holding a sandwich) and replace it with the picture of the woman holding the baby with the text of: おんあのひとはこどもをかっています。 That would be the perfect tie-breaker for me. If it is correct then I know what the difference is and if that statement is incorrect (and もっています is the correct word) then I know that it's the other reason for the difference. I'm pretty confident that さかな would go with いぬ and that たまご　and しんぶん go together. But I still see something like こども going either way depending on the reason for the difference. Hope I was vague enough while still being clear :p####$$##%NEGATIVE
Julian, they are always running special offers (I believe there might be one right now.) and you may also want to take advantage of their 5 monthly payment plan.  Five installments, no interest.  That really makes it affordable.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh man ! I love her! She's always trying to push. Me in my lessons and she's fun about it! I'm really great full to her for that!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah I love her too. She's always so enthusiastic.####$$##%POSITIVE
The Amish speak it as well, but the dialect that Amish and Mennonites speak is very different than what you would learn with Rosetta Stone or speak in Germany.  You might also check out the website meetup.com and search for German speaking groups in your area.  Many cities have groups that meet regularly over dinner to interact with others who are learning or have learned the language.  I am currently learning German with Rosetta Stone and I don't know anyone German either, but I am still loving every minute of it!####$$##%POSITIVE
That works.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I felt the Rosetta Course unit lessons were very easy to complete/pass but did not prepare me for my first studio session beyond the basic vocaubulary.  I even repeated all the lessons multiple times with flying colors before my first studio session and was still lost when I went "live".  It would be nice if the multiple choice options in rosetta course were not so blatantly obvious when the Rosetta studio (aka real world) is not:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Definitely, I feel like i'm being rushed and that I don't have time to understand what I've just said.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No worries Sarah, I've been able to return it now! Not an ideal process but at least its done. Thanks for your help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow, I have made a couple of returns and it was not complicated at all.  I'm glad that you were finally able to do it. . .####$$##%POSITIVE
It annoys me in Japanese too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Vielen Dank Thomas and Lidia for great sessions tonight!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Geoffrey - my system defragments every week, but I will certainly check that after re-installing. The software problem is with the RS sofware itself. Thanks, Christy - your support team have not been able to help after a week of several contacts (you may remember my earlier post here), which is why I will try this now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, Joey, but I have been told that several times this week without hearing anything from anyone. When I call I consistently am promised a 'definite solution', which has yet to appear. My patience has run out and I expect nothing but a full resolution within 24 hours, a replacement package or my money back.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I probably will be finishing Japanese in April. I can't wait.####$$##%POSITIVE
 I am hoping knowing it will help me get a good job in the future. I am also considering coupling my major with one in International Studies with a regional focus on East Asia so if I know Chinese, I can have a good background to someday live and work in Taiwan :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Trust the process.   Just start at the beginning, relax, pay attention to every detail in the pictures.   Take studio after you complete the first full lesson.   Don't over think, just enjoy.####$$##%POSITIVE
Take full advantage of the studio sessions. That made all the difference for me in learning to speak the language.  The coaches are fantastic...patient and supportive...and the sessions are a lot of fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Do a little everyday if you can, it is brilliant. I dont have the best memory and learning from books or discs didnt work for me, but this is! Also, be brave and book a studio session - I was very nervous to do this at first but am so glad I did, they are great fun and so helpful, the coaches are amazing and never make you feel silly. Good luck xx####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone for the input and advice!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi - I have done a system restore to undo the download of Adobe Air that was suggested by your staff last Thursday. This has resolved the issue. I am rather surprised that none of your staff was able to come up with such a simple solution, in spite of my repeatedly telling them that the problem occurred after I did that. I am very unhappy with the amount of time it has taken me to wait for and try out their suggestions, especially finding that I eventually had to find my own solution anyway.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats funny, I love it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I've always had a fascination with other cultures and their languages . I decided to learn Russian as sort of a hobby and as for German I had two years in high school but being that I haven't practiced or used it forgot most of what I've learned. I'm toying with the idea of becoming a translator in the near future. There is no better way to master a new language .Rosetta Stone has taught me more in a short period of time than I thought possible!!  Sent from my iPad####$$##%POSITIVE
I think it is really good. Currently I am using it for Spanish & Japanese. Later will be Korean & German.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Lawson. I definitely will!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've not received a message! I spoke to customer services who were less than helpful.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ah, no worries there; you'll have plenty of people to practice with in Rosetta Studio and World (you get them as part of your purchase) 15 months of unlimited tutoring (Studio) and game playing and chat  with natives and other Spanish learners (World).####$$##%POSITIVE
While it's definitely an advantage to have a native speaker at home to practice with, that's the best thing about Rosetta Stone. You'll have the native speakers in the Studio Sessions to practice with along with all of us others studying Spanish. You can also practice in Rosetta World in the Duo and Simbio games.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey Ben I'm doing the same thing as you (Spanish Latin America unit 1-5) though I'm up to unit 2 of level 1.  I'd be happy to talk in the program and work with you. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I have the Italian 1-5 and I love it, I am also looking for a native speaker to practice with-How might I do this?####$$##%POSITIVE
After 12 hours of yelling - yeah - I finally got what I was suppoed to get in the first place. At least they say it's in the mail.####$$##%POSITIVE
Works wonderfully! I have Rosetta Stone Deutsch Totale (Levels 1-5) It is great, my husband took a German course the same time I have been doing Rosetta Stone.I've done much better comparatively speaking....I vote two thumbs Up!####$$##%POSITIVE
It works.  Buy it. : )  I'm currently learning Spanish, but I know the method is the sane so I can definitely say, buy all 5 levels directly from RosettaStone and it'll be worth every penny.####$$##%POSITIVE
I do that!! I translate the things on the site. Working on German, Spanish and Portuguese... =)####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried to do that but there is no where to fill an application out on your site####$$##%NEGATIVE
Brian, I can definitely relate to having the same problem.   When your "seeing" the screen in your head and your trying to put the words together to make a sentence and then say it, its not easy.  Whereas on the screen or on the audio companion it's much easier.    As to rolling te 'R's, it takes lots of practice.  My tongue seems to have the same handicap.   All you can do is practice.  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I never could roll my Rs but I'm really doing much better with all the practice that Rosetta Stone gives me. Practice, Practice, Practice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gordon, Its worth every penny you'll pay for it.  I started learning Spanish with it in '09.  Never once have I regretted  buying it!  Plus, with their new version 4, you have a team of native coaches to tutor you as well as an online community of both natives and learners of German to practice with.  You can click on this link and see reviews of what other learners have said too: http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-german (click Customer Reviews)  I hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
Do NOT spend your hard earned cash if you plan to upgrade your operating system.  The program won't work on the upgraded system and they will make you buy a new Rosetta Stone if you want to continue learning.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I say it's worth it. You would spend more if you took it at a college believe me I'm in college and classes r expensive.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning german with rosetta stone and it is worth every cent.####$$##%POSITIVE
I recommend carefully considering buying RS, while looking at other options. There's tons of free and super cheap options to help you learn German. Don't let the price of RS be a setback for your desire to learn a language, because it's possible without even spending that much money! Good luck!! :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good luck Carol Ann, I have my first studio session booked for this Saturday.  A little nervous but very excited.  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I just ordered it!  Soo excited to get started.####$$##%POSITIVE
I really wish i had a dislike button for your wall post... what do you have against it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You take my money, a considerate amount, then tell me "go soak your head",  has the language changed or in some way different?  You are money grubbing, greedy people.  I am warning people to stop buying your product.  You people have NO honor and I want people to be aware of it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jerome I don't want to undermine your issue, but I bought V3 homeschool and used it on my XP. My XP crashed but I was able to get on it and receive the deactivation code, and put it on my new Windows 7. There were bugs that caused me to not be able to use it on my Windows 7, but I managed to figure out how to fix them, and it works just fine now, no upgrade patch needed. I'm not sure of what your issue is with RS on your Windows 7, but if you want to send me a message, I can tell you what I did that allowed it to work on my computer. It's actually a simple solution if I'm remembering correctly, consists of simply changing a setting on your computer.####$$##%POSITIVE
If I put out in excess of $500.00 and 2 years later when I upgrade my OS the product should still be usable, or the company should stand behind their product and offer an upgrade.  Beware, buy at your own risk and pray that Microsoft has nothing new in the works or you could be a looser too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone has contacted me and are going to make an adjustment, so, unless I am not satisfied with their solution there is no reason to take this farther at this time.  Thanks for your interest.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My husband is doing the Hebrew one and it seems to be going extremely well! Of course, he has me - a native Hebrew speaker - to ask questions and talk to!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well I bought a copy of it from this old pal of mine named Afton. I'm beginning to think that he might of given me a CD Rom with a virus on it!   Pfft. Shows how good of a friend he was!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Herzlichen Glückwunsch.. und wie gut ist dein Deutsch jetzt? Ich bin bei lvl 4 aber es fühlt sich nicht so an als hätte ich so viel gelernt, was ich eigentlich gelernt haben müsste.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just finished Level 1 in Deutsch and it's so much fun. How long did it take you to learn all this? I cannot wait till I can speak that much.####$$##%POSITIVE
i like to learn Arabic 1&3 but no free samples to learn####$$##%NEGATIVE
it is so easy to use, and it is definently fast! I just finished level 1 Dutch in just about two and a half months! I love this product, I can actually have a conversation with a dutch speaker, I recomend for sure!####$$##%POSITIVE
I really enjoyed the Studio Sessions! I'm actually planning to go back with my family to Italy later this year and looking forward to it! Hope by then, I will be able to speak a little more...: )####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Mandarin, Japanese and soon I'll start Korean and I've had no trouble####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been doing Hindi for two years now.  I love it!  I can read the script easily and I had some success in speaking on a recent trip to India.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah, it's totally one thousand dollars. -If it was 1k, it would be worth it-####$$##%POSITIVE
I am in love with Japan and Japanese! I just got Rosetta Stone full series! Awesome to know it's good! I wanna work as a translator too so thats awesome! And if your looking to be in Japan or near it i would reccomend Chinese. But do what you think is going to be fun :) -Nya~ <3 love ash!####$$##%POSITIVE
Haha! Thx bro. Every milestone is terrific!  Russian is the funniest to me cause of funny alphabet. And german is easier that spanish. (If you already speak english i think)  I can't wait to learn few more languages.. italiano? Francais.. etc.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Edward.  The bottom line is seeing constant progress is the ultimate motivator. It is so powerful it's almost intoxicating ! And that feeling of confidence and positive achievement carriers over into many other aspects of your life! Cheers !####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I am from Miami, You have to know Spanish for most jobs. Taking the demo I think the Spain one looks the best, and I believe I made the correct choice - even pescado - was different.####$$##%POSITIVE
I know every region has a different dialect, but I need the basics!  I am excited!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Haha! Yeah... been there. Not too fun. That's a great idea!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Gotta agree with Carolyn.  It's a pain in the butt to download them all.  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is only an issue on the pronunciation sections.  The rest of the program is going great.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would have to say the studio sessions are my favorite thing. I feal confident after and during a session and I love that we learn new words as we go. I also love being able to read my friend Inge's  posts, or at least some of the words.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you .....I purchased my RS from the UK. Arrived within days. Im still yet to use it because I dont have a suitable system to play it on, hence my questions before about being able to install it on other computers. Its s shame RS cannot find a way around the personal issue use, but I needed a laptop so ill be online soon.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta World is a hugely beneficial upgrade from V.3.  The fact that you've incorporated gaming innovations into language learning (both as actual games and accomplishment stamps and "gamer tags" with community interaction) really adds depth that wasn't there in previous Rosetta Stone incarnations. I bought the German program because I just like learning languages.  I also own the Japanese, Spanish and English Rosetta Stone programs for the same reason.  I used to live in Mexico and that's when I got hooked on languages.  Thanks for your quick response, Edward!  I hope those stories become available in the future.  I really would like to listen to them more often.####$$##%POSITIVE
i tried to run the Irish demo, but i keep getting "fatal application issue"####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much! I love Rosetta Stone! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, sounds good, think I will take advantage of it. Karen####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes I will. My cousin has the  one for Spanish, and she really likes it, and has learned a lot. Knowing someone who actually has it has been a great help in my decision to purchase it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hahahaha!! Awesome!!! I'm SO ready for the next question! :- )####$$##%POSITIVE
AWSOME!####$$##%POSITIVE
AWSOME!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, sorry, I am currently learning Spanish right now.  But since you have TOTALe, the best thing to help you not 'freeze up' is to spend more time in Studio.  With practice in there, your mind will get used to creating full sentences 'on the fly', if you will. It will take time, but you'll see results.  I hope that helps a little! Keep going! I've been where you are and sometimes still do that so just keep practicing and you'll get it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had the 'attend' button, but it wasn't loading.  When I turned my browser back on the program kicked it.  I was able to attend.  :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
My study I've regimented to approximately 1 lesson of a unit per week then that whole week is spent redoing parts of the exercises, playing around with the RS studio games and everyday I drive to work spending time with the companion CDs.   Also on my breaks I use the iPhone app.    Language isn't easy as you can see and takes a lot of work.  You have to 'immerse' yourself in it.  Heck, I drive my wife nuts with me walking around the house and pointing at objects and stating what it is in Spanish.  :). ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much.  One of my favorite things about learning a new  language is the fact that i can cuminicate with people from diffrent cultures. I love diversity. and i would like to learn as many languages as i can and thanks to rosetta stone i can accomplish that. I believe learning a new language is a way to better my self. Its such a pleasure to see the shock on peoples faces when i tell them that i speak a language other than english. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
To back it up. i didnt really become absolutley fluent in it. cuz this program can only take you so far. I had other help too from school. But using this made me become ahead of the students in my spanish class####$$##%POSITIVE
u guys r awesome :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you I have been helped.....I should point out im in the UK so that telephone number means nothing to me, but ive called the Freephone number here in the UK and have worked out a suitable payment plan which includes the Spring Deal.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Spanish; I've been learning it since June of '09.  It has been the BEST language-learning experience I've ever had.  I've even been told I speak without an American accent! I took Spanish in school and, well, I hated it!   I've learned so much from RS... it has been worth the time and money spent.  Every bit of it!    Buy it.  I'm confident you'll love it if you give it time and effort.  Buy it from RosettaStone.com and you'll get a 6-month money-back gaurantee just in case for whatever reason, it doesn't work out for you.  I hope that helps!####$$##%POSITIVE
i have been learning russian since I was six and now that i have rosetta stone it has improved it alot and it is a great program####$$##%POSITIVE
I"m learning German right now, and it's GREAT!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks Sarah and i will and this  program has been amazing to learn any langauge on####$$##%POSITIVE
No need to be nervous.  You'll do alright and even if you don't feel like you did by the end of it, you can always retake it as many times as you want- there is no limit! : )  I always retake every new session, myself.  Relax, have fun with it!  You most likely will freeze up when your coach asks you questions and that is just fine. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Music, movies, and reading signs in India.  We've traveled to India five times now and Rosetta Stone was so essential for learning the script.  It was fun to learn how to associate the sounds with the letters.  You know, we met people who told us how good our accents were, and I know its because of RS.  In India, though, its sometimes hard to get enough practice because nearly everyone you meet knows English.  Thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well Matt...to be honest it covered a whole lot more than my regular classes.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's glad to know there's someone else out there also using the Dutch version of this program :D####$$##%POSITIVE
That's wonderful Nancy! I haven't been brave enough yet to write much to my inlaws in Puerto Rico, but I can now understand alot of what they write on Facebook. You're right, with RS it can only get better!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning English con Rosseta stone y yo hablo Spanish...asi practicamos ok saludos!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
love a business that responds in a timely manner! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Even though I've completed Level 2 Unit 3, my studio session was for  Level 1 Unit 4.  I do 3-5 sessions per unit till I feel comfortable even though I'm further ahead in the course work. I think its time to just stay in Level 2 studios now.####$$##%POSITIVE
Now that I'm just about through with my RS course, I buy children's books and movies in Hindi and watch/read them without subtitles or dictionaries.  I also practice by putting up Facebook statuses in Hindi####$$##%POSITIVE
ahora entiendo yo tambien estoy en el nivel 1 de ingles!!!!!! y tambie se van repitiendo algunas imagenes!!!!! gracias!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I hope yours came with TOTALe! The online games and being able to interact with other learners is not only really helpful, but really fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi! I live in Italy since I was 5 years old (now I'm 20). My room-mate bought RS with spanish-Spain, and I noticed that it was so funny learning a new language! Don't worry, with rosetta stone you'll learn Italian in a way that nobody else could ever teach you! Ciao! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! :) I studied it in school, but now I realize how much funnier and easier it would have been if I had learned it with RS. I'm planning to buy RS to learn Spanish, and add a 4th language to my curriculum :) Ciao e grazie! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I already went to the website and I sent another message but they did not receive any answer. For that reason, I sent one here.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Don't worry, If you completed the entire unit you're ready. The coaches are extremely patient and helpful. The 50 minutes will fly by and you'll feel so relieved and confident when you finish, you'll want to hurry and schedule the next one.####$$##%POSITIVE
can someone please report him?####$$##%NEGATIVE
seriously innapropriate. and i think chinese is a wonderful language. but it requires lots and lots of practice. if you wish to succeed practice is necassary for almost everything. try hard and visit china. having a language surround you is one of the easiest ways to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Phil, I did my very first studio lesson today and it was awesome. Did another one tonight! They are very careful to pronounce the words and are really great with the encouragement. Just try it! :D ¡Me gusta mucho!####$$##%POSITIVE
Studio sessions are very relaxed and a lot of fun, you will love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
what a stupid question...####$$##%NEGATIVE
guys i need password to rosetta stone german so importnat i m wating you####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well, I will request.  I did the original Hindi with Rosetta Stone and did the more modern one right before they got the Rosetta World going.  So I am anxious to see what I've missed and get better too.  In India, people did complement me on speaking so well.  Of course I put a lot of work into it, but Rosetta Stone really helped give me the foundation.  I mean, I never would have been just picked up the script on my own. So I'll request it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome!  I felt the same way, Steve, about the foundation.  I have lots of other resources that I use, but none of them made any sense to me without the solid foundation that RS gave me####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome job Paul!!  You'll enjoy the studio a lot.  Be relaxed, because its very easy going and everyone else doing it is in the same boat as you.  Any questions about it, let me know.####$$##%POSITIVE
It went surprisingly well for me.  I was still nervous during most of it, but realize that I am not being judged if I do make mistakes.  YAY Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
That's too bad Matt! I am going to buy Spanish LA when it does go on sale.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You not only get a 6 month money back guarantee on Rosetta Stone's website, but you also get it at any of their kiosk/retail locations####$$##%POSITIVE
oui! i'm still on lesson one but its going good####$$##%POSITIVE
I've been taking about 30 to 50 minutes and reviewing the unit correlating with the Studio Session I'm about to have, and that seems to help.  I go through and do the lesson reviews again, and then go over my notes (yes, I take notes during lessons :P), and practice my (poor) conversational skills.  I LOVE your program, and I have been recommending it to EVERYONE!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm signed up for a session on Tuesday. I really like the Studio and World features in v4. I had planned to buy v3, but realized v4 didn't cost much more. The extra features were worth the extra cost.####$$##%POSITIVE
First, you can download the program onto two computers with up to five users on each computer (total 10).  As far as the program, I completed 5 levels of German and am working on ITalian and Japanese with RS.  I started the German program and finished it in about 6 months, but I had about 8 college classes in German before I started RS.  Rs gave me more confidence in speaking and understanding the language.  Also, I could go at my own pace - not the pace of a syllabus at a college.  THe studio sessions are great to get you speaking and understanding the language in "little bites".  THere are writing sections, but you are constantly seeing the language written in the program and hearing how it is pronounced.   I don't think that RS is a waste of time.  What RS tries to do is teach you the new language as you learned your first language.  This does not always work for adults as many want to know "why".  I believe that is probably the main reason that people say the program is a waste of time - no one is there to explain ever detail of grammar or other nuances.  YOu just have to "get it" by figuring it out or repetition.  For me, I joined the "meetups' in my town for the three languages, as well as finding SKYPE friends overseas.  I also bought dictionaires and grammar books off of the internet.  I feel that I need that back-up, and even if I don't, I like to know it is there.  RS is a course, and like any course, if you need to supplement it with something, you should.####$$##%POSITIVE
I believe that RS is worth the money that you spend on it. A person has to be willing to work at it on a regular basis and take it seriously.  I think that it is great to have a contact that you can use for questions (outside of RS) because it will help the language become "real" to you.  Have fun with SPanish and let us know how you do!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had 2 years of Spanish in high school and when I started the Spanish-Latin America RS course, words started coming back to me. I like the way RS has you learn the language better than how I learned it in high school which was essentially the translation method. As Janice stated, you won't get the answers to your "why" questions unless you search for them on your own. I sometimes use online translator sites to see how many different ways the sentence can be interpreted if I can't seem to let go of the "why" in my head, have trouble understanding the verb tenses, the plural and singular aspects, the masculine and feminine aspects, etc.  In RS, the recommended course setting is "reading, writing, speaking and listening" but you can change this setting to "reading and writing" if writing is what's giving you the most trouble.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh ok. Cool. Thanks Rachel! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's great.  And can you confirm that there is no time limit on the software?  Do we have access to the set for as long as we need it?####$$##%POSITIVE
Amazing, consider it sold!  Thank you for all the info :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I called about this very issue, rs told me I had to deactivate the program on one pc to use it on another, two could not run at same time.  ? ofcourse, their english wasnt so great either.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It has actually helped me gain a better memory. It has helped me with studying for tests at school.####$$##%POSITIVE
Me, too!  We want levels 4 and 5!! We want levels 4 and 5!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I think its a wonderful way of learning and speaking the language, but its still hard to get in a studio sometimes and now that I am working I cant just schedule one a week before since I dont know what my schedule my be most of the time.####$$##%POSITIVE
The live sessions are critical.  I signed up for 15 months after the free time.  That's 18 months total.  There is no substitute for live conversation.  The studio can be scary and humbling, but even when you're stammering and talking gibberish you are learning.  (We all stammer and spew gibberish).  Also, I like to make up my own drills in the course of my daily routine.  For instance, I see a lot of numbers in a typical day so I started trying to say the numbers in Italian.  Over time I got really good at numbers.  You can do this with anything.  If a person is approaching, ask yourself what he or she is wearing and answer the question in your language.  At first it will be difficult, but over time you will become automatic.  There is no end to the number of drills you can create.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosemary, thanks for the heads-up! Really, the chat feature was the best.  I signed in for the games, and got to know a little about my co-gamers.####$$##%POSITIVE
Geoffrey thanks for that info.. -:)####$$##%POSITIVE
and its free for me too####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm currently learning German, too, but JUST started Unit 1. :) LOVE it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well my computer didn't support it and when I found one that did I learned nothing####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've been using Rosetta Stone to learn Latin America Spanish for 5 months and I am suprised at how much I learned, RS does have its pros and cons and you will have to use other means besides RS to become fluent, and it also depends on your definition of fluent. RS will give you the tools, you just have to build on it. Good Luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi simy, was great to see you too, I always enjoy the sessions with you, much fun and laughter! Mi proximo session esta en miercoles a las una y media por la tarde, estas trabajando? x####$$##%POSITIVE
Si, todos los professores son magnifico, me gusta mucho Rosetta Stone!! :))####$$##%POSITIVE
That sux!!! I used his version a couple of times and liked it a lot!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
when dod cut there contract last yr with them they cut alot of languages that did make much money####$$##%NEGATIVE
Its amazing what you can do with just two levels! If you study hard, and progressively practice outside the program, you can voice many, many thoughts in your language. Ive had the opportunity of meeting only one Swede, but we talked in Swedish for a solid 45 minutes. Considering I'd never before heard about Swedish, and in under a year I became conversational, I can firmly say this is the best program! Many Finns who spoke Swedish said I was just like a native. It takes you as far as you let it : )####$$##%POSITIVE
* I can also read books in Swedish, such as Harry Potter####$$##%POSITIVE
Tracie, thank you, but with the way your company wants to squeeze more money out of customers for IPAD app - it will be a cold day in hell before I purchase any more of your  language programs.  I have two and wont buy anymore.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just had a really nice "studio session" at noon.####$$##%POSITIVE
yes, I understand, not interested in investing any more money, as this is a bottomless pit which Rosetta stone  has created.  I do appreciate your response, but your company does not play fair.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I also like the teaching method of RS, BUT I dislike how the material is sold. I am using a version 3 of the software and don't wish to upgrade it. Those who can get only the online version are felt sorry for. Because in case of version three I can take the CD pack and re-learn the languages whenever I wish and WITHOUT paying extra fees after having bought the pack first. But in case of online version you have access as long as you are paying for it. Then you cannot access it unless you pay more and more...  So, RS, I like your teaching method but dislike your marketing. Sorry if this seems to be a negative review but that's it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
To be honest I think it is fantastic value for money. You would pay FAR more for a course at a college and probably not be able to speak as much. Also the studio sessions are THE best way to reinforce what you have learned during the RS course and, of course, live tutors need paying for the fantastic job they do! And remember, they are unlimited! Take as many as you like or are able to fit in. It's truly worry every penny!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been quite successful in using because I use it a way most people don't. I have the Rosetta Stone Korean, French, and Spanish (Latin America) and I simply love it. Basically it teaches you more vocabulary and you will remember them because of how the program is setup. I on the other hand believe if you truly wan't to become fluent, you have to put that extra effort. Her is my method: In all the languages that I'm learning (French, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, and Vietnamese) I own an essential grammar book, dictionary, phrasebook, audio lessons, verb book, and an alphabet book (specifically for languages written in script such as Korean, Japanese, etc.). Including plenty on workbooks that have the answers in the back for self correction. This is the same method I used to learn English although it may not be grammatically correct. I feel reading has helped me as much as the software has. I use software more or less for pronunciation. So you need books. Don't purchase any books research the best of the best because there are alot of crappy language books out there. The next thing you need to do is get a language exchange partner! Its FREE and you get to meet new people. I personally utilize http://www.italki.com   Tutorial on how to use Italki Free Language Exchange Site http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daP0hFy7yMA  Become Fluent in Japanaese http://www.languageloversunite.com/p/learn-japanese.html####$$##%POSITIVE
Muchas gracias Simy, y gracias por todo su ayuda :))####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm just starting. There are many sounds difficult to replicate, so I'm not sure how good can you get at pronouncing some words by yourself. Nevertheless, it quickly gets your ear tuned to the language  You get a sense of how Arabic 'works' right away. It also helps you realize pretty soon what other things you can study on the side to help you out (such as the sounds of the letters, the use of diacritic marks, and the way a letter appereance   changes depending on the letter's location within a word). Though I'm not even done with the first lesson of the first level yet, I recommend it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks it's sorted out now.  Appreciate the quick feedback and solution.  Gracias.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm in version 4.1.15 - straight out of the box, new purchase.  Windows XP SP3 - been through audio settings and support docs.  No luck####$$##%NEGATIVE
We are in the same boat.  Mac OSX 10.7 Nothing seems to solve it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cecilia is the best!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Portuguese coaches rule! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Just go to Rosetta stones website and click on the free demo link, I just ordered the German cd because I learned a lot from just the demo!####$$##%POSITIVE
Really? Thanx a lot! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Ya no prob! I tried all the free language programs on the web and didn't learn anything but I did the demo and I know about 8 different small sentences and about 15 words!####$$##%POSITIVE
 Thank u very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
That happened to me today too! Rosetta stone tech support was able to help me!####$$##%POSITIVE
My problem has not been completely solved I can get in my program but not in session.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's a successful program :)####$$##%POSITIVE
hi thanks for the info,i am very excited !!!! i just bought it today so this weekend i will program the all thing !!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's such a great program :) Я также обучения Российской :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Once you're in the session the teacher makes you feel completely comfortable. It's structured so that they guide the conversation and all of the things you talk about are in your lessons. If you're stumped on a word you can let them know and they'll type it out as well as pronounce it for you, they completely understand that you're a new learner. Mine was extremely nice, understanding and fun so it went great. You go at your own pace so there's no stress. Just do it it's so worth it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I guess it depends on the employee and how serious they take their job. I was fortunate to have an awesome employee to talk to. That explained the ins and outs of the program and everything in detail to make sure I understood. She was soo nice as well!####$$##%POSITIVE
I understand that that type of behavior is not a usual occurrence, but it has really upset me and I would like to submit an official complaint against that sales person (any guidance on this matter?) Also, I wish Rosetta Stone would encourage customers to return e.g. membership or returning customer promotions. On a side note, is a military APO not considered within the US?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well something did not go right :( Started up Rosetta Stone Japanese and it told me that there were 2 updates. I let it download them and it gave me the download successful message. It said that it would restart the program and I clicked OK. Since then, for the past 2 hours it's been sitting on the grey RS screen. It hasn't shut down, restarted, installed anything, or given any other signs of life. Any suggestions?? The last time it did an update (when I initially installed the software) it did the same thing. 'X'-ing out of the program that time and manually rebooting the computer got it to work again although doing that messed something up in my first lesson which now indicates a score of 127% :) I'm on WinXP SP3. And, if this works right, this is the screen that I'm seeing: <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2u59z4i" target="_blank"><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/2u59z4i.jpg" border="0" alt="Grey screen on Rosetta Stone"></a>####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, mine went grey too. I just exited and restarted the program without rebooting my computer. And thank you Christy for letting me know!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah, I ended up shutting it down and rebooting the computer. I was a bit leery about doing that since I saw the posts about the updates causing errors for others. But I've taken a quick look and played one game and everything looks like it survived this time. No real specifics on what was done other than levels 1 and 3 were updated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
When I follow instructions, I re-installed program and get "fatal application error 2124".  I got this before, but fixed it. and then got the 8118 error above. I think I may be moving in circles.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Its very good! However, you get out of it the effort you put in; you need to use the language outside the program. I started off writing small dialogus as I finished an activity, that grew to become entire pages I could fill with the language. Uts so important to use it!####$$##%POSITIVE
awesome!  we can be language buddies! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeah I agree. Unfortunately FB doesn't give the option to switch back.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Already have, been to Paris twice. I have a girlfriend that lives in France. She of course speaks English for me, but I would like to speak French for her and move to France when affordable. You guys helped out!####$$##%POSITIVE
Enjoying the webisode now!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with Taneka. You will not become fluent using just RS software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't know if I'm supposed to write this on their site but I've been using other websites like www.studyspanish.com and www.123teachme.com... Even pages like spanish.about.com has helped me out soooooo much. Hopefully it will do the same for you :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ihave been checking my reports for 10 weeks with no problem, my problem is that I am doing it the right way and cannot see my reports  and i dont want to deal with cust svc   I have had other problems and rs cust svc does not fix the issue####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well when I paid for the online access I did so with my email addy. So I guess this means I am going to have to catch my own self up to where she is at in the level and then let her use my online access? I paid for 15 months worth and I'm not paying again. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Llevo 20 minutos esperando en la opción de soporte y no me contestan :-/####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Tom, It would seem thay would be adding not removing languages.####$$##%NEGATIVE
its hard to pick one thing. I am only on Level 1 Unit 1 lesson 4 but i have learned so much and am remembering it all too! my husband is a native speaker and he says I am doing great! thanks to Rosetta Stone :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm learning Spanish, Latin American. I knew how to say at least 20 things in about 2 days. I recommend this to everyone and anyone who wants to learn a new language. ####$$##%POSITIVE
My wife is Swedish! We have plans to move to there, but I still don't know anything about Swedish. Rosetta Stone software is really helping me!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanx for the support!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I have and I just did again. A Hungarian page I belonged to had many members that did as well. It seems useless.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks! It was useful at the stores, when I asked for information, when I got lost in the city hehe and talking to people in the hotel####$$##%POSITIVE
Went really well, thoroughly enjoyed it and found her very useful and understanding. Cant wait for the next ones.####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried to re-install, but it didn't work.  I don't have this problem with Italian and German - just Japanese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow! Good luck with it! I'm sure you will be really good very soon you language pro! ;) x####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes.   Obviously you have to spend the time with it, at least several hours a week, better a little more.  I've learned Arabic and brushed up on French with it.####$$##%POSITIVE
As RS said, it is available for some Androids.  To my annoyance, they seem to have a very short list of Androids.  For example: The Droid X which happens to be what I own, still does not support RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
For me it is worth it.  I travel often, and being able to make simple requests in the native language is important to me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Currently learning Italian and portuguese.   These languages are so easy.  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Yeap!!! I enjoy it a lot! I was FUN !!! I wanna schedule another session but the schedule is full buuah!####$$##%POSITIVE
I will have fun learning two languages at once >:D Rosetta World and Rosetta Studio are perfect for help in RETAINING what we learn... Learning another language is a "use it or lose it" kind of thing. PERFECT!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes this is what i'd like to know, i'd love to learn German, but can't afford £379 all in one go as i have a child to care for too! ####$$##%NEGATIVE
just uninstalled and reinstalled lesson/disc 3...got same problem in different spot####$$##%NEGATIVE
I called the help line thinking surely I am NOT the only one out of millions who have bought this to have this issue, all they could say was many people buy it and have success just fine! REALLY IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE>>??  Awful I will NOT recommend this to anyone!####$$##%NEGATIVE
If I can not get some progress in the next couple of weeks, I am going to return it for sure.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I find it so interesting how it works for some people and not at all for others. I too have the L.A. Spanish and have had great success, I've been able to have short conversations and get directions from native speakers. I was doing so well I went and bought the first level of arabic and it has not been going well at all I've had to by other books to supplement my learning####$$##%POSITIVE
Well is there an abnormal way of installing the languages because I'd rather try those.. I tried that way but its giving me the 9114 error thing.. It sees the language but it just won't install it..####$$##%NEGATIVE
It really is! And I thank the Rosetta Stone team for helping me turn my dreams into a reality right now! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much! Got it to work by restarting####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Lawson, i was just on the Rosetta website and I see that if you are a homeschool owner you can subscribe to the v4 online goodies for 1 month for $19 or for 6 months for $65 (which is cheaper per month).  I finally got my activation code for the free Rworld but it is dead in there, not a soul to be found & unfortunately there are no games you can play alone so i had to sign out.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have sent multiple messages stating this fact and all they could tell me was the email address that he put in wrong yeah I figured that out by myself####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, I am very pleased with your switch to Timeline - it looks wonderful!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's interesting to read what Sean says too.   The German has been working well for me. I have gone and bought Russian also but, with it using a non-Roman alphabet (like Arabic) I am anticipating it being a lot more difficult.   The support on this page is great too. RS has a great community. ####$$##%POSITIVE
U used to provide support to the federal government.  I worked with a lot of Americans who learned multiple languages late in life.  Rosetta stone was available and many of them loved it.  So I used it for Spanish, French, and next meandering!####$$##%POSITIVE
Be patient. Learn from the context. Try to get the idea/image in your mind instead of the translation. IMO, learning a language through translation makes i very difficult to communicate. The speaker has to essentially go through a mental gymnastic routine to assemble the language. I learned French as a second language and taught it following the same philosophy as Rosetta Stone and it works. Having said that learning some grammar and using a dictionary once in a while when needed IMO does no harm but I think relying on those tools slows you down. Just my thoughts. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love RS.  If u take advantage of all of the resources; games, stories, studio sessions, I think that u will make progress.  U just have to stick with it and realize that progress may be slow but it is cumulative.  I am doing French and got to level 3 in about 3 months.  You should do at least one thing every day, even if it is only a 5 minute adaptive recall####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you everyone, I have alot of ideas here to work with! Not giving up just yet, thank you for the support!####$$##%POSITIVE
So, now I can get on without the fatal application error code, but now I get a 8111 error code when trying to put in the activation code.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I totally agree with you Simy. My German sessions are always fun and relaxed. ####$$##%POSITIVE
I always enjoy the studio sessions and look forward to them, the tutors make them fun and help so much in building my confidence to speak Spanish :)) x####$$##%POSITIVE
Love them! And essential to absorb the language the RS way. I do 3-4 studios per unit and will probably go back and do more as a review after completing the course. Had a brilliant L.A Spanish studio last night with only 2 of us in the class with the coach. It was difficult but brilliant! The coaches are always fantastic at getting the language out of you! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hola Sarah, no me ha llegado ningun mensaje privado, intente de nuevo o envieme a micaelapereyra@hotmail.com####$$##%NEGATIVE
started a few days ago i love how it teaches you by making you pick the picture of the word it a very good system im more of a hands on learner :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello Rosetta ??  Here is one of many mistakes. Photo on left audio & text both say "yesh LO Mehonit" meaning there's not a car.  They mean to say "yesh SHELO mehonit" meaning that's his car.  Notice all 3 choices are missing the S so how ami supposed to learn Hebrew with mistakes like this ? Luckily i knew enough to catch these mistakes early on.  I will have to deactivate this software and return for a refund.  $300 is way too much to be doing the job of Rosetta workers. I should not have to pay for a bunch of pitiful mistakes!####$$##%NEGATIVE
not to mention that if it is an object in possession it is supposed to be Hamehonit and be "the car mine", not the other way around.... who does this stuff for Rosetta ?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good you know enough to catch those mistakes. But many others with it may not know enough to catch those mistakes.  I don't know any Hebrew and would be one of those people that wouldn't catch the mistakes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just got this Friday and really was looking forward to owning it but I am not keeping something for hundreds of dollars and me have to police the darn thing for Rosetta Stone, not gonna happen.... I saw a guy on youtube that had the same problem with Arabic, but took a chance anyway and it backfired on me.  Now i've gotta call Rosetta Monday and get this thing deactivated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hello Rachel & Rosetta:  O'K. i officially have it from my friend in Tel-Aviv that Rosetta Stone is correct and that it is saying "He has a car" even though it is a little confusing at the moment with the word "lo" in it. So my apologies for thinking it was a mistake.  I WILL be KEEPING the software and I just went and bought 100 shares of Rosetta Stone stock, so I'll be sure to mention that i own Rosetta stock when I pump up your company on my youtube language channel !!    RACHEL, BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER, THANKS !!!! You're are a big reason I'm keeping the software, I hope Rosetta works hard on making their customer service department people friendly####$$##%POSITIVE
We have tried to reboot the computer and that did not resolve it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I cringe just thinking about the RS hold "music." Worst ever! I had a headset issue the other day and found out Logitech uses the same song.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Britnie--we had 3 participants last night, which is pretty good for our small learning community.####$$##%POSITIVE
Gracias que amable, pero al parecer estoy ciega y aún no encuentro esa tarjetita, no se ha perdido nada, porque la única que ha agarrado el paquete soy yo, pero cómo que el cobertor, :S no entendí tengo que romper la cajita? o cómo. GRCIAS NUEVAMENTE####$$##%NEGATIVE
It works.  I've been using it for a couple of years to learn Arabic.  You should also know that if you buy it direct from them (not a retailer) you have six months to return it, no questions asked for a full refund.  That's plenty of time for you to answer the question for yourself.   I would say that you should plan on spending 2-3 hours a week with it in sessions of 20-30 minutes apiece to make really solid progress.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Geoffrey, I appreciate it :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Despite my current (very irritating) technical issue with their software, my other experiences with Rosetta Stone have been excellent. It's very easy to use, and the most fun method I've ever tried to learn a language. After finishing almost 1/4th of one level, my pronunciation had already improved greatly. When people type in Japanese (in English characters), I can make out the grammar of what they're saying pretty well. I even pick up words without meaning to while listening to songs or people talking in Japanese.   Most interestingly to me, I began to actually figure out what things I hadn't studied meant in Japanese in a kind of native way. It was like the same way I learned English, where I was picking the language up without translating. I could tell what things I learned meant without first making a translation from English in my head; at times, I didn't even fully know what the translation would be, but knew what I was hearing meant.  I recently bought level 2 of Japanese, just so it will be available when I'm finished with level 1. I'm confident enough in the program that I was going to buy level 3, until I found out that it wasn't available anymore.####$$##%POSITIVE
My mother has done Spanish levels 1-5. It took her years to finish all of those levels, but the result has been that she can talk to people in Spanish. She doesn't feel like her pronunciation is good enough when she speaks with native speakers, but Rosetta Stone has gotten her to the point where she can begin having conversations with people who know that she's still learning. My mom can also watch things in Spanish and understand what she's hearing.  As a story of my experience with Rosetta Stone, I started doing Japanese with it again because I as practicing at a very traditional Aikido dojo, and wanted to be respectful to visiting students from Japan who spoke very little English. One day in the dojo, they randomly sprang on us that while we were learning a complicated kata (a series of movements with a weapon), that they also wanted us to memorize all of the names for the movements and say them in Japanese at the same time, on the spot. I hadn't done the movements nearly enough to know any of them, so this meant that I needed to both memorize a long series of complicated movements with a staff, and remember how to say a bunch of things in Japanese at the same time. They had us do all of this in front of the class. To my surprise, it took very little effort for me to remember what to say with each movement in Japanese. I had to pay very little attention to the pronunciation, and was able to pretty easily remember what to say. My pronunciation was a lot better than some of the other students being asked to say the same thing, and I did better than I usually did on the Kata because I didn't need to work hard to get the Japanese right. All of that was after less than 1/4th of one level of Japanese.####$$##%POSITIVE
Interesting, thank you Brannon####$$##%POSITIVE
It has NOT been resolved. I was sent instructions by e-mail, which do not work. And now your phone line is closed???!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Alex! I finally got a moment to reinstall the level and it worked! By the way, I think it's neat how I can do my lessons on my iPad!!####$$##%POSITIVE
The program is correct. There's nothing wrong with it.####$$##%POSITIVE
There is something wrong if it doesn't recognize that I am pronouncing words right.####$$##%NEGATIVE
At first I liked the studio sessions, but now I am beginning not to like them, the last few times I felt like I was being rushed and I dont think thats right, especially since I am not a fast talker, I might just wait until I move and immerse myself.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It has been a couple of months since I have been on because things have been very busy around here.  I tried to log on but it wouldn't take my log on. I had changed my email address right before I stopped logging in and I thought that might be the problem but I tried logging in under the old and the new one and I still can't get in.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No. I found your phone # and connected with someone live and in a few minutes he walked me through the process and everything is fine, thank you for getting back to me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your reassurance. Your responses are generally prompt and I am sure you will try to help. Since what we are enduring this for a long time with little compensation for our time and the technical support is clearly a common failing experienced by your consumers, should you not resolve it to our satisfaction, this is what we will do. We will take screen shots, video clips of the software malfunctioning, put in a narration and let it go viral on the web. This is drastic action but unfortunately you continue to consume a lot of our time. This may help you management consider the consistent failing of the technical support service.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thank you Alex! I did! is working!####$$##%POSITIVE
I use Windows7 on my laptop. It has been working fine without any errors until now. Then I have been receiving that error message for one or two days. The software still works fine, but I get that error message at every start up. Thank You for your kind help in advance. I do appreciate it. :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yea none of that helped....but still trying####$$##%NEGATIVE
Got it working!!! You were right!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
That worked! Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just started learning Spanish ( Spain ) .. just today ... and I feel I could Speak it fluently by the end of the year ...  I tried many other courses... best of them was for the Italian language .. I did terrible, and I thought I could never learn a foreign language but English .. but that Immersion system that I follow in Rosetta Stone is more than awesome .. I even wonder why they don't use Rosetta Stone in schools ??! .. thank you Rosetta Stone .. Learning a new Language has never been that Close ! :) <3####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Simy, but you are the best! I hope I will meet you soooon at the next encounter! The last time it was so a pleasure to learn with you :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Simy, I agree with Dieter, you are the best! You have helped me so much since I started Rosetta Stone, my confidence has grown so much and I enjoy talking with you. :))####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Simy - I had the first level 1 studio session with you today and loved it - muchos gracias!!  - I've only been learning for about 2 weeks but feel like I really was able to understand just about everything today - you even make the new hints easy to understand - looking forward to the next time you host a studio session :o)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm going to move to Austria for Love. So Love motivated me to Learn German and I heard such great things about Rosetta Stone and find that it is true.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Kyle Whalen - I would suggest spending about 1/2 hour every day or so with RS.  Best to spend short sessions often than big sessions rarely.  This is a huge benefit of the RS system, you choose the time and the effort while a classroom course you haven't that control.   The words for "Stop" "Help" and "Police" you will learn early in all their language courses :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Good luck!  It's a lot of fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Simy, I love to be in your studio sessions! I hope to see you again soon. Thank you for making my experiences with Rosetta Stone as great as you have! Hopefully the next time I get to do something with Rosetta Stone, I will get to meet you too. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your help. I managed to solve the problem. It works fine again! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Same boat! I only signed for 3 mos and i've tried to call...and left waiting, then reply to their sales emails that going to continue....Very poor business!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, Rain, for checking into it.  The situation is now resolved. It's good to be right with Rosetta.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, Rachel. Yes please, I'd like to watch it. Can't fault the customer service from you guys!####$$##%POSITIVE

Ciao Rachel! For Italian, just over a month now and it's REALLY been great learning RS. So far, I had four studio sessions with my coaches Monica and Giampaolo and they're both awesome! For Spanish, just about a week, currently in Level 1.  My current progress in Italian has significantly helped me in my Spanish! Can wait to do my third language - Portuguese! Mille Grazie!####$$##%POSITIVE
Was disappointed in the response regarding Haiti.  For a company the size of RS I would have expected a more professional response.  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Very much, thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just like to go through the lessons.  I'm doing (Latin American) Spanish and enjoying it a lot.####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice to meet the new CEO and also hearing from the coaches...  everyone is a dynamic speaker and portrays the excitement that your product offers. I have been a customer for about 3 months now and am part of the Compass. I made the right choice with Rosetta!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the webinar, and also thank you for limiting the time.  It is difficult to stay on more than an hour!####$$##%POSITIVE
yep...   I know.    thanks for your reply.   I am a slow learner ;-) so  it gets expensive for me to keep paying for the subscription service.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your team's enthusiasm motivated me to do better with my French studies.  Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
interested in the business and learning about the people behind the program####$$##%POSITIVE
Super advice from both of you. Thank you for your encouragement!####$$##%POSITIVE
Mi sono piaciuto Unit 3 e 4. Sono stati molti interessante!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks. I ended up returning the discs and purchasing Rosetta Stone online and haven't had a problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! That happens to me too! Especially when I'm reviewing lessons, it's kinda very annoying lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sent a reply back. Problem not solved yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have never used the IPAD app but I have online only version. I have this problem many times and it's frustrating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Annnnd solved!  Rosemary's my hero of the day. Thanks for turning the rainy day around!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Alex. It works indeed. Have a good one.####$$##%POSITIVE
After clicking on the link you provided above takes me to your home page where I can sign in / choose a language / watch advertisement, etc but I can't continue to reviews. How can I get to your subpages, please???? It is annyoying... :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
These comments are all so very helpful--thank you so much! I am feeling re-energized, and I think I will take a different approach:  slower, more studios, more review and games. Mille grazie!####$$##%POSITIVE
That was useless, given I already contacted customer support for help and they haven't done anything or gotten back to me. I'm not on a PC and I'm not running a windows operating system so those fixes aren't useful to me. I'm on a Mac OS so it'd be nice if someone would actually help and give me some useful information. I mean I spent $600 for this program the least it could do is continue to work.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay yeah that seems super easy! Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I can try to answer your first question.  I have gone through level 2 of two different languages, and can say that it does get easier.  I like that there are sentences that I can analyze in the program and figure out what things mean.  Eventually, you will get it.  I admit that for the three languages that I am studying through RS, I have had college courses.  I know that I need some explanation, so I use other resources.  I love that RS emphasizes comunicating in the lan guage and pronunciation.  WHich language are you learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
thank's very much Janice for taking the time to point out great resources and tips and strategies. And I do admire your goal of conversational fluency in several languages.And about your dog saying thanks - did he learn how to do that thru a special RS course?####$$##%POSITIVE
I think that it is a good thing to study the language that you are learning with RS somewhere else.  I have done that with the three languages that I have with RS.  RS is a good reinforcement (and GREAT for pronunciation and communicating effectively in the language), but the other places tell you the why (grammar, vocab, etc).  Hopefully, others will look on the internet or somewhere else to get a better understanding of the language they are learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
Awesome, I had never thought of MeetUp. I'll have to think about doing that to polish my pronunciation skills. God, I love languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much for the info! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
And me and my partner love learning Spanish so much we are saving up to move to a Spanish speaking country and teach English as a foreign language! We are so motivated now! Thank you so much Rosetta Stone!!!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
RS v4 will not open on my computer and I can't get "chat" or email ticket opened to help fix it.  How can I be patient with a $500 product that doesn't work?####$$##%NEGATIVE
although I was impressed with personal CS emails, "things" didn't happen as expected.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Help! Still no way to contact technical support.  No way to leave open an e-ticket,  live "chat" still doesn't work, and it's terminal "hold" when calling in.  Also no response to emails.   I know, I'll dispute the RS credit card charges because RS can't or won't deliver a usable product.  Ah yes, that's what I will do.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome Nivek! I can't wait till I get there! I'm still on level 1 but, I'm near the end!####$$##%POSITIVE
If you haven't noticed my name is Kevin as well (Nivek is backwards). Yeah, dude I'm telling you. Go all the way from the beginning of Level 1 to the end of Level 3. You will learn a lot and if you come across Japanese people they will get surprised. Especially me being Latino. The Japanese don't expect a Latino to speak Spanish and much more that I pronounce Japanese very well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks everyone. Though I think I'm more confused than ever (LOL) it's good to know I'm not alone.  I appreciate everyone's input. Kevin thanks for the friend request. I'll accept and probably take advantage of the offer.####$$##%POSITIVE
Excellent!  Thank you, Tracie!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's not the pronunciation - it just doesnt register a response at all when I speak, even quite loudly. I know I am saying the words right.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I finished Purtugese 3 levels in 6 weeks. You get out of it what you put in to it. I exchanged it for French in Nov. and I will finish the lessons in probably two months as I am in 4/4 now and just have to do the 5 level classes. I am continuing with the French studios,however. I need them for fluency in conversations. Sorry about all of your technical problems. I had very few but I did have to wait a long time to be connected tow support.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am addicted to it and this is just my second day. If I had the money to purchase the entire set, I would have. I will deifnitely save up to get the other levels. For now... I'm in Spanish heaven. BEST LEARNING TOOL EVER!!!! Tonight was my second studio, Frances was an amazing coach. She's in Florida....can we get her a raise? lol####$$##%POSITIVE
@Tokia: I have had studios in German (finished 5 levels) and Italian (finishing level 2) and all the coaches are pleasant and knowledgeable.  I am also working in Japanese with RS.  IT is a great way to really USE the language!!####$$##%POSITIVE
@Janice. I do not understand why multiple email addresses. I makes no technical sense what so ever and is a major burden on the customer to setup and maintain.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks. I just bought a language online (need to get up to speed by late fall, I found out Friday), and I capitalized three of the letters in my email.  I got a confirmation email after the purchase.  If I have any problems, I will contact tech support.  Thanks for the info, Rosemary!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love studio chat! I also love meeting new people from studio chat! It's so awesome to be able to chat to someone who can relate to what you're going through####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, this got results.  I got an excellent on-line technician who took over my computer and solved the problem quickly and efficiently.  I am appreciative!####$$##%POSITIVE
Not many Italian learners!?  Your kidding!!!  >.>  I have a pipe dream of visiting the Vadican some day...  This  is why I picked Italian...  My family thinks I'm nuts for not taking Spanish!  XD  If their are so few of us we should make a group Laura!  Memorie isn't a problume if I can look at the answer right before I type!  ^^  Thank you SO MUCH!####$$##%POSITIVE

With my new iMac the Rosetta stone cd I have is not being accepted (says it cant download) but when I go to my old snow leopard it works just fine. Apple said you guys haven't updated with their lion update and that I'm not the only one to bring this up####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for your response. I'm trying to access the link from Switzerland and it simply leads to the front page of the German speaking site, not to the Swahili course link... Can you help me with this and/or provide another link?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Britnie! No rush, I can't reinstall until I get home later this afternoon anyway. Thanks again for the help, it is appreciated!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Christy. I will reinstall all three levels when I get home. I may need assistance with the product activation at that time but I will be able to tell as I go. If I do need assistance I will open up a ticket. Thanks again, I appreciate the prompt replies.####$$##%POSITIVE
I just finished level 2 last night; I actually began learning French my senior year in high school, but I started from the beginning again with Rosetta Stone as a sort of refresher course.   Retention isn't really a problem; a reoccurring program glitch - it was either error 3111 or 4111 - is making it difficult if not impossible to finish the first core lesson in Level 3 Unit 1.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It opens, then it looks like it's trying to process my login information and then it just closes down. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for looking into this!####$$##%POSITIVE
I was able to make it to course contents...but there is no longer Swedish on the list. There was one a few months ago! Where did it go? Thanks for your help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you SO much! I got it! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, great service! I expected to wait much longer to have this problem solved.####$$##%POSITIVE
That worked, Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Joey, thanks for your useful feedback....####$$##%POSITIVE
Haha. I find the milestones difficult too. You have remember to look ahead to the answer in order to work out what the question is. Confusing. Starting my Russian next month; can't wait to see how I get on compared to German. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't find the milestones difficult. It's too boring for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
MIlestones - yuk! They are supposed to test what you have learned in that unit, but sometimes end up confusing you.  I have yet to do one in Japanese - we'll see!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like the studio sessions more than the milestones in my opinion.####$$##%POSITIVE
Molto bene, Grazie! Just having a fantastic time on the course! Hopefully, when I depart for Italy this July for my summer vacation, I could use a lot of what I've learned...:)####$$##%POSITIVE
Adrian, I'd recommend taking the Rossetta Stone course prior to taking the course in University.  Rosetta Stone will get you familiar with lots of vocabulary and get you used to hearing sentence structure.  The class will then teach you the grammar and rules that are missing in Rosetta Stone (they say they 'teach' grammar in RS, but my experience is that it's lacking).####$$##%NEGATIVE
Happy to retract the above. Rosetta Stone sorted out the issue and found there was a mis-communication about the source of my order. I have received my activation number and will be starting my son on the program this week. Many thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
i ordered one of their "free trial" cd's....still waiting 2 years later...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Mickey, I hope the will make it right now. They took care of me today!####$$##%POSITIVE
I clicked on Attend, but all I got was a Fatal Error message saying that the site couldn't detect my speech component.####$$##%NEGATIVE
seeing and hearing the instructions at the same time, vey helpful. the energy exuding from the presenter, priceless!####$$##%POSITIVE
Gosh, Tracie, I guess you need to read my post a little closer. Yes, my problem was solved but how stupid it was that I had to wait on hole for 10 min to be told that I had to go to the online chat only to be told to restart my computer 2 times. I guess the phone guy was not as smart as the online girls.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That worked!  Thank you Shanice!!####$$##%POSITIVE
They charge $99 to fix a problume your having with THIRE software by phone???  That's rediculess!  Who in the world would PAY THAT!?!?!?!?  Even if that's a type-o and it's just $9 that's SITLL a little high....####$$##%NEGATIVE
No typing required in the Studio season. Relax and have fun. Even if you make a mistake, or forget, they will help you. Enjoy. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Hurray!  Thanks Jenifer and Shanice.  I had the same problem and this worked for me as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
The check marks disappeared again : (  Hope you have better luck Janeth!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi! As a fellow Spanish learner, I can assure you that it definitely gets more complex as you go along. Toward the end of the first level you will move into the past tense, and the second level covers both past and future tenses. It's a great product, please give it a chance. I've been learning Spanish for a year now, and I'm shocked at how far I've come with this product. I'm sure the folks at Rosetta Success will also respond to your post, but I thought you might also want to hear from another student. Good luck with your studies, and please keep with it. You'll see that it does get more complex as you go along. If anything, you might want to look at these basics as a refresher, to reinforce what you've learned previously.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you both for your response and your encouragement. I am very motivated in getting back on track with the Spanish language. Most previously learned material has gotten buried somewhere in the abyss of my brain. I lost my lingual sparring buddy for a while so here I am. I had contemplated returning to the classroom to take classes but as a busy working mom of two young boys, this seemed to be more ideal.      So, here I go. Feet first, I am taking the plunge. I am taking your word for it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok that's great! Where did you get my email address ha!?  Thanks for your help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for all your help! : 3 I'll be purchasing Spanish 1-5 promptly tomorrow!####$$##%POSITIVE
Simy, I can't wait to be in another of your sessions soon. I've missed you lately, as my schedule has kept me from being in sessions when you're usually teaching. Have you seen the learner testimonial video on Rosetta Stone's YouTube page? I'm in it! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hello Arman! I actually work for Rosetta Stone and I use the Chinese course for 30 minutes a day three days a week. I have found it relatively easy to learn because I have utilized the option to have both the characters and the Pinyin (latin alphabet) both at the same time. This makes things sooooooo much easier!####$$##%POSITIVE
I beleive that Rs is good for learning to actually communicate in the language.  It emphasizes conversational fluency.  If you want to speak the language then RS.  Classes at the university are great to learn grammar and the structure of the language.  For every language that I have done with RS, I took a college course, but RS was invaluable for actually getting me to speak.  You can only get so far in a class since there are other students and the teacher has to grade so she/he is going to have to give written tests.  Knowing the structure and grammar (and being able to ask questions about it) is great in a classroom setting, but my ultimate goal has been to communicate with others.  Rs get you on the right road.  As with learning any language, you need to supplement with other sources to get the full experience.####$$##%POSITIVE
One way that it is different is that you constantly have to DO something.  I have been in classes where you just dit and listen and you are bored.  THere is constant repetition, pronunciation and grammar segments, and you have to repeat.  Also, the studios are great - you and up to 3 other students have 50 minutes with a native speaker who goes over the unit that you just completed.  That really gets you involved and speaking the language.  I finished all 5 levels of German and it has made a big difference!  I couldn't put a sentence together after 8 college classes of German. Now, I can communicate and don't have the same fear that I had (all that practice).  I am currently going through Italian and Japanese. . . .####$$##%POSITIVE
I have submitted a request once before a couple of years ago with no results yet. But I will request it again. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
That would be great because this product doesn't work.  And the people who are supposed to help you are not helping.  I don't know why people like this product -- apparently they actually get customer service.  But the individual person who buys this product on his/her own, is treated like crap.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still no change.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much all! Have a great day.####$$##%POSITIVE
I did have a bit of issue with my audio during session not sure if instructor could hear me well.  They did have someone help correct it but not sure if will have issue with that again or not.  I had issue similar to that earlier.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes I was afraid of that. The iPad microphone does not work well with totale especially where there will be external noises. Most of the time the iPad just can't pick up what I am saying unless I hold the iPad very close which defeats the purpose of portability. I hope your engineers will work on this issue otherwise you only have half a product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes , I'm learning Turkish and Spanish . I love RS soo much .  :)####$$##%POSITIVE
>.>  You know, just becose the product does not work for you, doesn't mean it doesn't work for others...  Know how you learn!  I have Dyslexia, so I think mostly in photos...  Rosetta Stone works with that vary well.  I'm also committed to this, so I don't skip days a lot...  Offten I work on it seffrel times a day...  If I have free time I'm speeking Italian or at lest listning to it.  I am also finding it usfull to look at some exsternal sights for grammer help.    Odds are you eather were not working with it enough or you do not learn best with photos and would have more success with a traditional program that uses more translation.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Simy and Edward! Simy, I did great because of instructors like you. :) Hope to see you again soon!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok, great! Thank you. I'll save the link for when the time comes.####$$##%POSITIVE
ahh that settles it then..puts all my doubts to rest mate...thanks a ton for taking the time out to patiently reply.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much for the suggestion!  Wow, what a wonderful customer service!####$$##%POSITIVE
It was able to activate for 15 months.  It was good after all. Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok great!  Thanks so much!!####$$##%POSITIVE
That worked! Thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well that form letter certainly absolves you of any blame for extortion.</sarcasm> They took the listing down but according to the article you are still insisting "pay us or we'll sue!" A man is DEAD, his parents are trying to raise money for his tombstone, and you are extorting them for something their DEAD son bought and which may or may not be counterfeit. Poor form.####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes, when I read this I realize that sometimes, an excellent company like yours may have someone in their legal department that doesn't have common, compassionate sense... we recommend the foreign language students that are struggling to buy your excellent software, I just wish you also had excellent sense to see what's going on in here: a man is dead, and all you want is your payoff. Truly sad.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, yes, it helped, now it works!####$$##%POSITIVE
No call yet!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Chris Hutto I can appreciate that you need to combat piracy and that you are very active in this regard. However, having worked in the software distribution field as far back as Software Resource, Ingram Micro-D, etc and I have never heard of someone being able to verify software authenticity without even checking serial numbers, dongle keys or similar keys associated with the exact single package, much less by looking at a simple photo. To go so far as to demand a fine before even firmly establishing the authenticity of the software, especially in light of your company knowing the circumstances around the acquisition of the package, I question both your honesty and your integrity as a company. Perhaps I am missing something, perhaps you worked with these people to obtain those codes but from what you have said, and more importantly, what your CS/CR/PR departments have NOT said, it appears that you went on a fishing expedition at the expense of someone's dignity at the most most vulnerable time in their life. You should indeed reflect on your actions, as I can assure you, most of your customer or future customers will. 2 seconds ago · Like####$$##%NEGATIVE

Well after the telephone call to you about 3 months ago I just tossed all my R.stone disc's in the garbage. I am registered with you--when I initially bought it new. I now have an iMac, os x 10.7.4. When I called up about 3 months ago to inquire why my disc would not work, I was told you no longer support the new Macs and I could buy a yearly subscription for my Thai learning. At which time I felt sick that your company would make my $300 disc worthless!####$$##%NEGATIVE

I have dealt with so many people already. They give me an LPN number that my bank has no idea what it refers to. Rosetta Stone tells me there is nothing else they can do. Then they send me a screen shot of their (Rosetta Stone) confirmation showing an amount being sent to someone, but with no indication where it went or for whom it was meant. This is a simple refund to my credit/debit bank card. I've meet with my bank and three different departments, and they see no indication that a refund was sent from Rosetta Stone on my behalf. I feel I'm getting a runaround and I'm getting angrier about it.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Find an attorney in the area that will take the case pro-bono, and file a DJ action against them in your back yard.  This is total crap.  I understand RS's need to protect their IP, but I also understand the need to meet the customer service needs of clients and potential clients.  This is a disaster for RS from the PR perspective...####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hi Jenna! I had a similar experience. I had downloaded Japanese to my old Mac PowerBook, but after a year the hard drive died. I purchased a new MacBook.

Thanks for the super speedy friendly & (hopefully) helpful response!! I will let you know how it goes when I take your suggestion! Sooooooo excited to get out Japanese on!!####$$##%POSITIVE

Alan, if you need tutorial help in French, I am fluent in the languagge...have you started your basics yet?  Rosetta Stone is Perfect for learning any language.....I had basics of french in high school and college, and when I got to the conversation area of French, Rosetta stona helped me a lot....Bonne Chance avec l'apprentissage du francais!!!!!!! Avoir Bonne journee!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
First of all, thank you for your fast response:) So, as I have understood after having read your e-mail, the only way to have some connections and friends is by attending to the studio sessions or to the Game Night. Otherwise, it isn't possible. Can I just see and have a connection with the random  people who are currently online?####$$##%POSITIVE
ok thank,well I had already installed my course in my computer but my computer virus grabbed me and tube clean and clear the course and avansada taxes and install it again but it asks for a code####$$##%NEGATIVE
i cant find that option either. Can you please advise how I can access to purchase it. Many thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
when you get a chance please give me a link where to access the site to purchase complete online access for turkish. I tried to navigate through your website but coud not find. thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rachel, Rosetta Stone has great customer service! Have my problems always been resolved with the first call? No, not always, but your employees are always courteous and have a real desire to help me resolve my issue. If my initial contact with the ‘front line’ customer service representatives doesn’t bring a resolution, then the representative will quickly transfer me to someone who can provide additional resources. The quality and responsiveness of your services are consistent throughout the organization. I don’t judge a company on 'if' I have to call customer service, but, rather, how they respond when I do contact them. Problems happen and issues arise- it is our response, (on both sides of the issue) that really matter. jane####$$##%POSITIVE
You probably could.  But you could also stay and just listen to get the exposure. Start with the lowest level session and take it several times until you are comfortable to move on.  Also, the coaches are very helpful and patient and they will meet you at your level.####$$##%POSITIVE
It was Japanese. I had Mari who was lovely. There was lots of laughing and nobody made fun of each other. I got the feeling everyone was willing each other to get the right answers. I went into it thinking "if nobody understands me after 10mins I'll leave". I was pleased and surprised that I was understood and I stayed for the whole lesson.####$$##%POSITIVE
In other words, the sound files are played back silently.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh.thanks and hope we can have other levels too!rosetta stone is my best friend####$$##%POSITIVE
this isn't as easy as I had hoped it would be. I'm going to go another route. It was far more expensive and far more effort than I wanted to do. Your product looks great, especially the online version...but there was no discount offered to transfer over to the online program. I think I'll just use Edufire. Thanks anyway.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Ive been checking my spam and everything and never found any contact. :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm only getting level 1 then 1234 in blue circles beneath - how do I access level2? I've defintely done all the units on level one now - thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's so sad about the QES. All the recent love from Nigeria is bizarre too...and annoying; it's difficult to keep up with everyone's learning journeys because of it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hola Cielo,  Me encanta este programa también! Rosetta Stone usa "Dynamic Immerison" para enseñar el idioma en una manera intuitiva. Así espero que tengas una experiencia buena de aprender un idioma!####$$##%POSITIVE
The link worked like a charm.  Thanks for great customer service.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Linda,  I am happy to hear that you are learning a new language. Although Rosetta Stone may seem expensive, it is actually priced very appropriately (in my opinion). Colllege classes are far more expensive, and cheaper language CDs/tapes only teach you to "parrot" common phrases instead of learning the actual language. Trust me when I say that you will see far superior results using Rosetta Stone than just using language CD's such as Pimmsleur. Nonetheless, I wish you the best of luck on your language-learning journey, wherever it may take you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Linda! I agree with Aaron above me. I tried the Pimsleur CDs from my local library once for Swedish. All those CDs do is teach you phrases from rote memorization. While it's always good to build some vocabulary, those CDs don't teach you how to react and communicate in real life situations. The Rosetta Stone software and the included live Studio sessions give you real life experience with the language itself. Depending on where you're located, your software purchase includes live, online lessons with a native-speaking instructor (called Studio sessions). Those sessions give you the opportunity to interact with a native speaker. You have the chance to ask questions, get gentle corrections, and build your skills the same way you would if you were learning in a total immersion environment (such as visiting the country whose language you're learning). The Studio sessions are a lot of fun, too!    Even the software itself, without the live instructors, has amazing speech recognition and can tell you if you're mispronouncing something. It also detects where you're having trouble learning, and you revisit those weak areas in reviews.   All of this is a bit long-winded, and I'm sorry for that, but I can't praise the Rosetta Stone method enough. They have sample lessons on their web site, maybe you could consider giving it a try. I've been using their software to learn Spanish for a year now, and I'm able to have fluid (but not yet fluent) conversations with people- something I know I would not be able to do with language CDs alone.   Whatever you choose, good luck with your language learning endeavors. If you have any questions about the Rosetta Stone software, their Success Team will be happy to answer them. If you'd like information from just a general software user, feel free to ask them of me. Best wishes!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love the sound  of French when spoken, its beautiful. Also, after many attempts of self teaching, I found a good system in Rosetta Stone.  I'm learning it quickly and I'm amased.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Britnie! Though there were only two of us online, we did get in almost an hour of games. It was fun! Maybe for future versions of the Totale software, they can program it so that a reminder about game nights comes up when the student logs in to use the software or to attend a Studio session. This might make game nights more popular. Regardless, thanks for having these nights. Any opportunity to practice is always appreciated! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
How about simply supporting the software as you said you would until the end of this month, instead of instructing your tech support people to recommend I pay for an upgrade I shouldn't have to pay for.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I found my question answered,  thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes! I will! I'll probably be trying it out tomorrow if not this evening? I need to check studio availability. But, I'm super excited since it's been a month since my last studio!####$$##%POSITIVE
LOL. Thanks for your two cents. If RS has a web presence in social media, then they will be expecting this. Furthermore, they don't need lackeys like yourself defending them. They're more than capable of defending themselves and, as I expect, deleting my posts. As for "certain ways" of doing things, perhaps you need to consider that I have already exhausted said "proper channels" and failed to come to a resolution. Furthermore, you care because.... ???####$$##%NEGATIVE
How about making it a little cheaper? $100 on top of the $500 already spent to be able to use the program on the go is quite ridiculous. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I purchased Rosetta Spanish levels 1-5. I'm currently using the 3 month trial of the Total-E. I don't have time to take advantage of the online tools or the studio sessions. I only use for the mobile access on the iPad. I wish Rosetta would consider allowing free use of app for the regular lessons, without the studio access, to those who paid for the computer software. Traveling a lot, it'd be easier to take the iPad to continue learning with rosetta instead of being at a computer, but I can't justify paying for a subscription just to use the software I already paid $400 for that I can use on a computer. Please consider this!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have a complaint about the product, that it is only compatable ith ipad2 and up...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did the trial.  It is nice and works well, but it is not worth the added expense.  I already have the discs and was hopeful that the mobile version add-on would be affordable.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was just hoping for this today - too bad it won't run the studio sessions on the first gen iPad but even the rest of the app is a great fit for the iPad.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I will research this and thanks for this great networking tool :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I go to any international corporation website and they have theirs in every major language. Here is someone who claims they can teach me a language and they don't translate it?

Where is user friendly anyway? This kind of stuff makes me crazy. Why is it you have to know how to get in the back door when it could have been clearly posted on the front..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your quick response; I made these remarks by telephone to a young man in customer service. I remember this so clearly because I was stunned by Rosetta Stone's unabashed indifference to improving its product.  I also told him that if he would give me a discount on another language I would tell him where these errors were.  He said, "Go ahead.  I'm not going to write them down anyway."  As a professor of Swahili who has published a great deal of material with respect to Swahiliphone africa, and that I had found these errors in the first of two programs in Swahili, your customer service person reasonably could have thought that I was just learning the language and was hardly competent enough to tell RS that the editor could have missed something as I was just a neophyte. In all this correspondence, RS has not expressed any interest in learning where or what these erors are. What can you do?####$$##%NEGATIVE
lets just put it this way...I keep getting mail from your company about how I owe you an UNPAID balance, but I called and fixed that weeks ago. I HATE companies that can't get their account files straight between departments.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks a lot for your answers! And of course!! The App is pretty cool :D it is  such a nice tool now I don't need to carry with my laptop wherever I go! The sad thing is that I purchased my Rosetta Stone German 1 year ago, but I didn't have a lap top to install it, I was in the process of acquiring one but I didn't know and I never opened the software till 6 months later, and my 12 months subscription had already expired :/ but still I've been Developing such nice skills with it :) Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Biz! I'm just a learner here (not employed by Rosetta Stone), but I thought I would comment on your post. I've never heard of the test you mentioned, but I thought I'd tell you that you can demo a few of the languages that Rosetta Stone offers right on their web site. It gives you a sample lesson from the language(s) you choose to demo. If you try a couple of them, you might find one that you like and that would be easy for you to learn.  I'm not sure how a test could tell you which language would be best for you to learn (though that would be really cool!), but the nice thing about this software is that it teaches you the language the same way you learned your first language- through total immersion. I think that makes it really easy to learn and remember, and it's not dependent on translation and grammar as a base.  Whatever language you end up choosing, good luck and have fun! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Christie. I already found that link. My firewall is not blocking the service and my time is right and computer rebooted. The problem is that your software does not uninstall clean and when reinstalling it fails. That in turn leads to all types  of other issues when trying to manually delete file. In addition your software has no repair option. I write software for a living and not uninstalling all files when removing software is plain sloppy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta, thank you, wish I had seen this video before I bought, I of course did the google search and I cannot get my money back. And the bank said to get the money back I have to have proof I returned it, I cannot find the seller so I am out the money, hard lesson learned!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love my husband for being so focused --- we are on a great journey - I'm relearning Italian like now and at some pint I have to fresh up my French again! Having LATVIAN as Rosetta Stone courses is our dream since that's where my husband's heritage lies! We requested it several times but have NO idea what the plans us --- can anyone update us --- THANKS and VERY honestly, congratulations for your AMAZING program!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'd love to know why you think that because I've worked on both Arabic and French with it.  It has been enormously useful.  So, it would be good if you can tell us what the problem is for you.####$$##%POSITIVE

I must agree that the price is steep - but it is for a reason.  I've tried to learn Hebrew for nearly 10 years - and with nearly as many programs!  From Meligua to Learn-Now! - none of them gave me the boost that Rosetta Stone has.  It is easy to use, and easy to jump right in to.  Just my opinion :-)####$$##%POSITIVE

It's still not working properly.  :-(  I went and did the update for Windows and it seemed to install like it was supposed to (it gave me all of the correct screens and everything), however I am still getting the message "There is an error with this application" every time I open Rosetta Stone.  What's strange is that my box says I have the personal version of Spanish Version 3, yet, when I insert the disc, it acts as if it wants to install the Homeschool Version.  I know the problem is definitely not my computer . . . I just got a new laptop with tons of memory and great graphics and stuff and so that shouldn't be a problem.  I of course paid a lot of money for this and I would love to start using it . . . any more suggestions?!!?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried filling in the form here:  http://www.rosettastone.com/global/anti-piracy-initiative  I get an XML error message on submission.  I will now give up and let the pirates carry on.

I think it's normal to be confused at first. If you're just on the third lesson, you've still got a little ways to go yet before you can have a full-on conversation with confidence. The most important thing to do is to try whenever you can. The more you practice, the more confidence you will build. That's what's so great about the Studio sessions. They're the perfect chance to practice with a native speaker and get gentle corrections and lots of encouragement. Courage et bonne chance!####$$##%POSITIVE
I wish I would have known this before I spent so much money to buy it.  I've tried everything . . . I just don't think it's going to install properly!!!  :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I work during the day so I cannot be at my computer. I did try the online chat 3 times this weekend. It said I was connected, but no one ever responded. So not even that works correctly. Also, the submit button in the chat dialog box is hidden. There is no indication there is more to see. The only reason I found it was because I decided to try tabbing. I will try to contact tech support again tonight. Unfortunately, the hours are for the east coast and not the west coast.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The software is glitchy. It skips parts of the units for no reason. What version do you have. I have version 4. Unfortunately tech support is only available during the work week. So I have minimal time on the west coast to get help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Look at the wonderful e-mail I received below. I don't know about everybody else on the west, but I actually either am getting ready for work or work during the hours anyone can help me. This is just one more case of this company being a total joke. 9 am to 10 PM EST is 6 am to 7 pm on the west coast. Unbelievable. What kind of international company offers these kind of limited support hours. I guess if you live on the East Coast you can get help, but if you are on the west coast you are just out of luck. Dear Mark,  Unfortunately I was not able to reach you by phone today.  I would like to arrange a time when I could contact you by phone to resolve this issue.   I am available Monday through Friday from 9am to 6pm EDT.  Please reply to this email with the day, a time range and the phone number I can contact you with.    If the times I am available are not convenient for you then I can have one of my colleagues contact you during our normal business hours:  Monday through Friday from 9am to 10pm EST or you can contact us by calling us at:  1-800-788-0822 and ask for Tier 2.  Please give Case #01101886.  Regards,####$$##%NEGATIVE

Christy, The tech support people that I first contacted tried , unsuccessfully to follow the steps you linked me to, see attached, You can see how far they got by  what they left on my desk top and the trash. that tech staff removed the "other" files and then trashed Flexnet Publisher and Flexnet. I am at step 5 the "Back" button . When I clicked twice it takes me out of the linked page, I can't find or get to " Flexnet Licensing Service folder. They may hve done steps 5-12 because they were attempting to downloadRosetta StoneTOTALe . They said it would take about 20 minutes to download then they would call back. after 30 minutes the download message stated  that the remaining time was  one day15 hours. . So I left the computer on all night . the next morning it said " 3 days" and it continued to rise. And that was to install only 262 MB.What is next step?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Didn't work on any of my browsers.  The windows have changed. The promos have changed.  The prices have changed.  I spent 40 minutes on live chat with a customer service rep that was completely useless.  I had two products in my cart and they simply went up in price as I was looking into the various changes made in version 4 and the computer versions as well as the changes made to the regular CD apps since I last purchased the software.  I recommended this to thousands of people via Twitter and was very upset when I couldn't even get a confirmation that there was a change in promo at some point this morning.  I simply wanted to ensure that the price was changed or a promo expired whilst I was trying to make headway with your website.  I make recommendations to many people and organizations and this took hours of unnecessary searching trials and unanswered requests.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I purchased a language that is only available online. I do not have a USB mic, so I have not been using the voice recognition feature. I do have a RealTalk mic, but it does not work well with the program. I've called Rosetta Stone SEVERAL times to inquire about slowing down the audio on the program because at times, the audio is spoken too fast and I'd like to make sure that I'm hearing how certain words are pronounced. Each time I've called I'm either transferred over and over and/or I speak to representative who ends up telling me there's nothing they can do to assist me.  This is my first time using Rosetta Stone, but if this is the kind of assistance that is made available, it doesn't help those who would like to learn a new language. Slowing the audio doesn't seem like an unreasonable feature to have on the program. I paid a lot of money to learn this language and I only have access to it for another 3 months. I am not getting my money's worth if I keep having to listen to the audio at a fast speed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you both, it is down to the excellent learning programme Rosetta Stone offers, and the wonderful coaches who give you so much confidence. x####$$##%POSITIVE
I did follow their instructions and reinstalled the program several times. I believe this is an issue with the programming and not the installation.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I certainly will, you did awesome. I was surprised at how easy it was to  learn things that way.Keep up the good work!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just finished my first studio and it was fantastic. Linda was great and made it real fun. I learned more and understood more than I thought I would. And thankfully there were some good clicking moments. This is a much less stressful way to learn a language than my previous experience in classes.####$$##%POSITIVE
FacebookDear Rachel  Thank you for your email. The 3 lessons you mention are ones I have just attended within the last 2 weeks and so of no interest to me at present. If we look at the rest of Level 5, then Unit 1 is the best served, just, and has a class on 4th July (one of the few dates I cannot manage) and then the next one is on the 9th July, followed by a number from the 11th July onwards. I am particularly interested in times that are 1130 to 1430 CEST as these are the times when our (unreliable) functions best here in the Spanish countryside. Unit 3 has nothing until the 11th July and Unit 4 has one at 0330 (no thanks) on the 5th July followed by the inevitable 11th July at 1230 which is a long time off and was the principal cause of my initial email. As you can see, when we are advised to take 3 or 4 classes per week and can only have 2 on hold at any one time, there just are not enough classes at adequate, let alone ideal, times to make this possible.  I hope this has been of help to you.  Best wishes  Graham####$$##%NEGATIVE

Glad you gave it a try! Give it a few more chances, you'll love them before long! What language are you learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
The instructors are great at adjusting the sessions to each learner's abilities. You'll see as you go along that at some point, you'll be that person who gets to ask all the questions! :) One of the reasons why I like Studio sessions so much is because the instructors are so patient and so willing to help. Even when I've had a "bad" lesson, I've never left feeling bad. The instructor always was encouraging and I learned from my mistakes. Lots of luck with your Japanese studies. I hope you'll have a great time learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Crystina,  While I have never personally used Rosetta Stone to learn Arabic, I know many people who have. In addition, I have studied Spanish extensively and now German with RS. I can assure you based on my own experiences with RS and those of many others that RS's proprietary Dynamic Immersion technology helps make TOTALe a great language-learning solution for any language, including Arabic. For more information about learning Arabic with RS, check out the following link: http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-arabic?cid=sm-fb.  Best of luck on your language-learning journey! Aaron####$$##%POSITIVE
I have studied Spanish (Latin America) extensively with Rosetta Stone and have also learned some Italian, Swahili, and most recently I am starting to learn German. From what others have told me, Arabic is quite difficult, however it pays off to learn it and Rosetta Stone makes it easier to learn than most other methods.####$$##%POSITIVE
ありがとうございます！ Thank you, Rachel! It's been a lifetime goal to learn Japanese and I'm really enjoying the progress I'm making with the RS software -- it's great! I just wanted to let you know that I find my ability to learn is that much better if keep a journal of sorts to follow along with my learning of the Japanese writing system (kanji mostly since I already know hiragana and katakana) and with learning new vocabulary as well. I think it makes the learning experience that much better. Thanks for responding to my comment. Y'all are awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
It went very well! I did reschedule my session, and this time for the correct unit! In fact it starts in 30 minutes.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would love to join. However, I have had and still have troubles finding an available class. I gave up few times and can give another try. Is it possible to have more sessions for level 3 and 4 on Tuesday and Friday evenings EST?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've already done the free demo. I know your program works, I just can't afford it myself. I'm interested in the Latin American Spanish. Too bad you guys don't do raffles or anything :( It might actually be a good marketing technique ;)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Lauren, I will give it a try. I appreciate your quick response!####$$##%POSITIVE
The problem is that only SOME of Rosetta Stone's sound plays over the headset. This is an issue with Rosetta Stone, not with Mac sound preferences.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Either there is a hidden setting within Rosetta Stone for choosing where the sound on different types of screens is output, or Rosetta Stone has a bug. Or Rosetta Stone is doing something that triggers a bizarre bug in OS that causes the switch, but since I have only encountered this problem with Rosetta Stone and NO other software, I would expect that the problem is with Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried to change my settings so i can buy more online-time. I changed my profile to Germany, but it won't let me purchase a subscription in euros. Can someone please help me give you my money so i can continue to learn German?!####$$##%NEGATIVE
your german company only tries to sell me a brand new copy of Rosetta stone too ... why is this so hard?!####$$##%NEGATIVE
i am tempted to give up on you guys####$$##%NEGATIVE
Fab thank you, its always fun to get to talk nothing but French and have to really think about what you have learnt####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I was studying spanish, but now I feel with RS methods I cant learn it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just began Russian. So far I am liking it very much. I dont have too many to practice it with but my mother and my grandmother, they are both fluent. I think so far I am very happy with its content and the way of teaching.####$$##%POSITIVE
I realize that. But tfree "support" is not what I need.  During Case  Number 01176649 I was told I would have to pay $19.99 case and then aslo pay for the reinstallation. I already feel like I splurged and paid too much for this. There are emore economical ways! I have all CDs and the registration # card.  If I can't recover this product for free it is not worth paying agian.  I am already losing a lot of time on recovery from this unfortuante break in.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The problem isn't moving the directories. I simply can't get it installed period. Many new machines run small SSD drives to simply boot into windows quickly..i.e. mine does in 12 seconds but for that and various other reasons (i like the recovery options) I have a small C drive now which is enough to accomodate the system only and a few basic necessities.####$$##%NEGATIVE
the german company would only sell me a new copy of the program and would not even give me the option of renewing my online subscription... :-( ... the american company is looking for a solution, they said they will get back to me in a few days via email ... I would have figured you guys would have run into this problem before ... i have changed my info to my german address on everything but the payment method ... when i change the payment method it says i have entered an invalid email address and password, but there are no fields to enter either ... there is some type of error in your software ... i am affraid to buy a pre-paid credit card with dollars on it because the address verification does not match up with german addresses and i don't want to lose the money it would take to buy the prepaid card in case it doesn't work ...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosemary,  I have just finished sending this to my credit card company, not only has Rosetta Stone not refund my initial payment but after receiving the package back on June 21, 2012, they now have charge my credit card with the second payment of $79.80 on July 3, 2012.  The RMA number:6469466.  I have a real problem understanding how Rosetta Stone is trying to provide excellent customer service for customer, when each time I have called customer service it was a 45 minute wait to talk with a live person just to be tranferred to someone else that put you on hold again. This happen's over and over again, day after day.  They now owe me $196.51####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Rosemary. Just after I finished the session, I saw the message at the top of the screen below the "Ready to Schedule" button. It's gone now though. However, I wasn't given a stamp after the session, which is French, Level 2 Unit 2.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Whats even more appalling is that after spending $500, you have to spend MORE to use the iPhone/iPad app.  That should be included.  Seems like all Rosetta cares about is money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
To Charles: I have attempted several times to establish a live chat, per your email instructions to request a Tier 2 Agent.  Each time, I have been disconnected.  What is your next suggestion?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your link is for a different customer.  Again, not living up to Rosetta Stone's marketing of being so wonderful.  I just want to use the product I paid $600 for that I ordered directly from Rosetta Stone in 2009!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would like to add my opinion here as well.  Like others, spent alot for the box cds.  Its OUTRAGEOUS to pay MORE for iPad access to the same course.  i understand that some parts, like live tutor, sould requirea subscription, but not access to a mirrored version of the cds.  ROSETTA, we are in a recession, and this will come back to bite you!!!!! Do the right thing and allow iPad acess to mirrored content as PART OF the original purchase price!!!!! You wanna charge for live tutors?  Fine, do it as an in-app purchase as an upgrade.  Unbelievable!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I found that my experience with Rosetta Stone was equally fulfilling. The service was great, the shipping was fast, and when I had a question; the support staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I purchased the Portuguese (Brazil). The heritage is rich, the people are super friendly (like Southerners used to be), and I believe the ability to speak a second language opens many doors and really shows us just how small the world really is when put into perspective.####$$##%POSITIVE
Pay money for what i didn't undersatnd####$$##%NEGATIVE
i understand noww thx for helped####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you soo much Hunter and Rosetta Stone in company! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
yes,  i didn't imagine that i can learn new language alone  , but with  Rosetta Stone things seems v. easy ....... thanks a lot :)####$$##%POSITIVE
grasia por tu ayuda pero ya lo resolbi grasia con representante muy  amable####$$##%POSITIVE
gracia de toda manera####$$##%POSITIVE
Again, a reply without an answer...frustrating.  Gabrielle Mandola, can you help me out again?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much. I shall look for your number and try to ring this evening.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Rosemary. As per your advise, I was able to speak to technical support representative over the chat and resolved an issue I had. Thank you!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
hola, muchas gracias por su respuesta haganme saber si es necesario que les indique mi numero telefonico para la solucion del problema  saludos gracias####$$##%POSITIVE
They are fun aren't they Gina, I have gone to several now and learnt a lot more about the programme than before.  What language are you learning?####$$##%POSITIVE
I sent one earlier via the RosettaStone web site and will be happy to send it to you too, Rosemary. How may I do this privately? I did try the phone again but had the same problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I posted the information you asked for but it has disappeared from this msg string.  What is happening??####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am really not a "happy camper" dealing with this mess.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hmmm. RW won't let me register...maybe because I still have a RS online subscription for studios.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for your reply, Christy. I do have version 2 in Arabic, French and Spanish. System requirements included with the software simply list "For Installation with Mac." They do not include or exclude any specific operating systems. Now Im no techie, but typically when buying software, the MINIMUM system requirements are listed. If it needs Windows 98, I know XP will work. Ive never had a problem with my OS being "too new."  I understand you cant create software to last through the ages, but I want a $400 extended language program to last more that 3 years.        Also, I have a fundamental problem with your "upgrade." An upgrade implies that you are offering an optional modification to improve on my already functional program, new, better features, etc. You're forcing me to spend MORE MONEY for a program that will allow me to simply install the original purchase. This falls far short of an upgrade and I find this a despicable marketing practice indicative of low-rent programs looking to stretch a revenue stream from already loyal customers (Ive got over a $1000 in RS product, and yes, I will drop the program, not for the "upgrade fee", but for way I feel I am Columbia-Music-Housed into the product.) WIll RS require another "upgrade fee" every time I upgrade my Operating System?   Thank you for your offer to call customer service, but I have already done that and received the same scripted response, which is why I am posting here and elsewhere.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thats my point! Its not an upgrade, its a new product! I will not pay for any new RS products until we can make the original purchase operate as advertised. At $400 per, Im not going to buy a new version every cople years.  Im trying to get product support from you people and all you want to do is pitch me the "latest and greatest."  How do you expect to sell me on "games, mobile apps and better graphics" when my point of contention is the program wont even install. Your disconnect with your customer base is incredible. At this point you continue to insult my intelligence and my business worth. You have effectively lost a customer and referrer.####$$##%NEGATIVE
And dont tell me what kind of evening to have......####$$##%NEGATIVE
I will definitely never buy that product####$$##%NEGATIVE
Its still just sitting there loading on a black screen.  I have good internet service.  The laptop is fine.  It's been 20+ minutes now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It won't let me send u a message on here.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Rosemary - I appreciate Rosetta Stone's quick and satisfactory response to this issue!  Can't wait to get started with it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks , Michael. On Demand is a  great feature.####$$##%POSITIVE
That's just it. I've learned words, however, they have no meaning to them. How am I suppose to learn a phrase or sentence without knowing the meanings of the words? ####$$##%NEGATIVE
A visitor here from China just watched me do the first two lessons of the Mandarin demo.  This is a language completely foreign to me and one I have never studied.  I almost always guessed wrong on the first question, but she was amazed at how quickly I could get the answers right by looking at the pictures and the words, figuring out what they had in common and how they were different and figuring out their meaning.  She even said my pronunciation was pretty good!####$$##%POSITIVE
Glad it worked for you. Ive got 3 RS programs and no valid Application program. But they are more than happy to SELL me one. Almost $1000 wasted.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yea. It doesnt work.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Newer MAC's don't get along well with older versions of Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok so spent another 40 minutes on the phone and 2 chat reps and still getting the same error and no one is able to solve the problem. I was told to call again tomorrow... WOW this is ridiculous.  I wonder what the rest of my Rosetta Stone customer experience will be like...####$$##%NEGATIVE
That gave me the Italian demo...####$$##%NEGATIVE
HA! "Try" she says! What she doesnt say is if it doesnt work you are assed out! Good luck. Pimsleur works with all systems.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was steered to purchase the home school version and apparently from my discussions with your sales person at SeaTac Airport it was not what I should have. I am traveling to China for two weeks next month (purchase the program almost a year ago) and wanted a basic grasp of the language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The first box arrived without any of the disks and when I saw the display at SeaTac noticed it was on the IPad which is something that would have been really useful to me. When I inquired about why I wasn't able to do that the discussions led to the fact that in her opinion I should have bought the Version TOTALe. I really feel like I have wasted a year and had a lot of frustration since I am having to get through a lot of stuff that is not at all useful for my needs. I would never recommend your product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agnes, it makes sense to me that it would be presented this way for Hungarians, but if Rosetta Stone is selling the exact same version of the program to both Hungarians and Americans, they fail to understand the role context plays in communication.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was only joking by claiming it was made for the Hungarians, although we do count the week beginning with Monday. Rosetta Stone tries to produce universal softwares in each language. So it does not really care about the users' cultural background, unfortunately. Furtheremore it does not really care about the language and culture specific things either. It teaches the same material in each language to each user regardless of the cultural/linguistical background. This is one of its main disadvantages, I think.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good luck getting any positive response.  This page is full of Rosetta Stone disappointment stories.####$$##%NEGATIVE
To be honest, the availability of Spanish Spain studio sessions is ridiculous and I am constantly emailing to get sessions opened. Which we shouldn't have to do, it's a service we pay for and forms an essential part of the totale programmes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got it!! thank you both!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ok ..maybe I did not explain ecxactly the TROUBLE. I am able to log on, but in ITALY is NOT possible at present, to UPGRADE any language at Level 4 TOTALe, for any language, therefore I CANNOT use it on iPad with the application TOTALe Course, that is downloadable from iTunes in any country and here in Italy too. That's ridiculous... Would you please provide? I have sent a lot of mails already ..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Muchisimas gracias Lauren, ya me contactaron y me resolvieron. Gracias por el excelente servicio!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
your comment has disapeared #rosettaStone from this post please could you reply thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much I got everything taken care of! thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for reply.i have tryed some free programs just to see what its like.and the problem i am having is programs would say the word and Thats it.its too fast and spelt in Russian.i cant say and learn the word properly as i dont know what way its really said or spelt how to say it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I downloaded a free russian alphabet app on my iPhone before I began with RS. Spending a few weeks getting my head around the letters & the sounds was a massive help. Now, after Level 1, Unit 1, I find I can read most Russian words without having to think about it too long.####$$##%POSITIVE
alright Ben.i have started Russian alphabet yday.but finding it hard.not sure what the best way to do it.learn the sounds in order or just eachone and what it looks like.the problem i would have with rosetta stone is no translation and not enough proper sentences that you would need in the world.greetings ect.not that is a boat or something lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
.: Aha... you guys fixed a main bug there. Good job for the web development team! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
Simplicity is the key. Love the website :P####$$##%POSITIVE
Looks great!  Very easy to navigate now! This design is very much user-friendly (compared to the last one)!####$$##%POSITIVE
I like the new design. One thing I'm noticing right away is that your "Select a Language" dropdown on the home page doesn't work with JavaScript disabled. I recently set up pretty much the same functionality on a product I'm working on, and was able to have it fall back to working with JavaScript disabled. It's fairly easy to do, and nice for that small percentage of users with JavaScript disabled. If your developers want some advice on how to do it, they can message me.  Looking around the new site some more, I really like the directness of it. The design is so simple and clutter free. I can get to exactly what I want right away, and without having to guess at how to find it. At first I thought that you went with a mobile first approach, but I see now that your site still uses a sub domain for a separate mobile experience. Your new design is simple enough and straight forward enough that I think it could translate well into serving all devices with a single site. Do you think that you'll do that at some point?  I like your URL structure. Your developers must be really into intuitive URLs. I like the way you re-did the support section. I think the choice to use a light pattern there for the background instead of the usual dark pattern was a good (and interesting) choice. I think it's interesting that your support section actually changes design styles based on the language the user looking at it understands. I'm noticing that it doesn't just change languages and images, but actually changes design styles to match the web design aesthetic preferred in the part of the world where that language is predominantly spoken. I'm very impressed by that attention to detail.  As a new user to the support experience, I'm a little unsure that the support home page needs as much information as it does, presented right away. While I think that the information is well designed and the layout fits a lot into a small space well, some of the information seems to create noise for a user who's brand new to that section and possibly already frustrated. For example, the slider of support team members might better achieve its purpose by putting a human face on each support interaction, instead of on the support home page. I think that the majority of your users entering the support section will be looking for help with a problem, and while you've given prominence to a solution search, that may not be enough for someone who is already confused and irritated.  I do, however, really like how well the support section and the rest of the website blend together. I didn't even realize until just now when I saw the: "Back to RosettaStone.com" link that I was in a subdomain. I'd consider doing some user testing to see if users prefer a bigger link back to the rest of the site, or maybe even the support section logo being split into a main site link and a support section link, if you haven't already user tested that.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love your new website!!!!!! It's really cool to see amazing features that the previous version doesn't have. RS, keep up the great work!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice.####$$##%POSITIVE
Nice one,i love it####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, I wasn't confused by your terms, just disappointed by their rigidity and short-sightedness. Much as I enjoyed the quaintness of such a 1980's-style customer service experience, I'd rather not invest another $200 with a company that shows so little appreciation of their customers, so I'll be switching to one of your competitors.  Thanks for the reply.  I'm sure my unopened Level 1 French will make a lovely doorstop.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please quick i spend time a lot for waited ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im still cannot go studio  session####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well I noticed it does run a bit slower than the old layout (possibly still more tuning to do?), but I think it looks great. Nicely done.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ah nuts, canned response!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Canned response with typos, no less.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome.  If they weren't eleventy-billion dollars, I would probably buy several of these languages.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the tip.  I'm learning Spanish and am probably just over-thinking the situation but there are some instances where you can't really figure out what the picture is exactly saying.  I'll have to check out google translate as a helper!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Don't worry, just be confident that if you've studied the core lessons in the unit, played the games and completed the milestone, then you'll do fine. The instructor/native speaker is very friendly, helpful and patient. I've done two studio sessions and I WAS very nervous about my first one. I really enjoyed them both and was amazed how fast the time went. Sign up, you'll do fine!####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, if I may add, one thing I like about Studio is that you can't fail it... its not something you test for and can fail.  It also helps me if I redo the session until I feel comfortable, so be sure to redo it as many times as you like. : )####$$##%POSITIVE
I've done two sessions for Unit 1 Spanish and they were both different. Depending on the progress and proficiency of the learners you'll see different slides and the native speaker will ask you different questions. I learned new words in each one. My first one paired me with someone who was not ready or really nervous, I'm not sure which one. The Native speaker was very patient and helpful with him. It did make it seem slower for me, but I'd rather have the sessions be a nuturing experience rather than something to be afraid of. The second one there were two other women who were very good, so we had a more interesting and lively session. The main thing is that it was fun and I'm getting much more confident with my new language!####$$##%POSITIVE
I was nervous too, but I found out after my first session that there was nothing to be nervous about.  Your coach will help you be successful and if you forget a word, don't worry about it.  You WILL feel successful after the session.  I've had 4 now and one of I repeated and it was different.  The slides will be the same, but the teacher might ask different questions so you get something different out of it if you repeat them.  Have fun and you will have fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
i've just bought the swedish course im so happy to read this!!! <3!!   TACK!####$$##%POSITIVE
I understand the vocabulary great, but the sentence structure is where I need the help.  This is where speaking with a native speaker was helpful and pronunciation as well. Antonia did a great job and was so nice and helpful.  I was unsure that I could actually complete the session with out speaking any English, but I did it!  Cual es differencia? Pregunta No se####$$##%POSITIVE
Did my studio session yesterday.  It was very good, and really helped reinforce what I've learned. Some new concepts and vocabulary were introduced, but after a few moments of "duh", I managed to get the idea. I will likely schedule a repeat session - it seems like a great practice opportunity. I did have some difficulty hearing the facitator though - her sound was a bit fuzzy. I had no such problem hearing the other student in the session, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't on my end.####$$##%POSITIVE
I think the Italian language is beautiful, plus I have several friends who speak Italian (my friend here on facebook, Teresa Rotundo is from Italy).  I would someday like to go to Italy.  Plus, it's actually funny that I'm the one that can speak some Italian (thanks to you guys), and my husband who is half-Italian, can't speak a word (other than a few bad words).  I have so much fun with the programs.  I'll sit at the computer for 2 or 3 hours at a time just going from lesson to lesson.  Plus the Adaptive Recalls lessons are so helpful, too.####$$##%POSITIVE
Common sense would tell you that there are no customs to go through for a shipment to Palm Desert lol.  It's ok...returning product tomorrow after getting crappy customer service even after notifying them of their failure to deliver on time.  All I did was waste more time emailing them back and forth.  Avoid this company!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had to buy a different head-set because the Rosetta Stone one's were horrible.####$$##%NEGATIVE
And some sound files are just impossible to get right, especially the shorter one-word tasks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Herzlichen Gluckwunsch und gut gemacht!  Ich lerne auch Deutsch bei Rosetta Stone und habe viel schon gelernt!  Ich hoffe dass du mag Rosetta Stone.  Ich hoffe auch dass Rosetta Stone deine Probleme reparieren werden!####$$##%POSITIVE
My main problem is, is that I apperently can't say grün correctly. >.>####$$##%NEGATIVE
Estoy aprendiendo Español con Rosetta Stone. Sí, es el mejor.####$$##%POSITIVE
the TOTALe mobile companion is more like doing the actual course, it's not just audio, but it's interactive with images, and you can speak and have voice comparison as well. It's not the entirety of the course, but it's a nice tool to use when you're away from an actual computer.####$$##%POSITIVE
And the mobile companion is excellent.  I used it earlier this week when traveling.####$$##%POSITIVE
Tonight, I found a post where it spoke of deactivating the software and then uninstalling/reinstalling so I thought I would explore that option on my installation. However, magically, I no longer get the Fatal Application Error even though I haven't done anything to my computer since I last tried the application. So, issue one, done.  Issue two: two Rosetta headsets on 3 different computers, and neither are recognized by the computers. Frustrating!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
My first Studio Session was fun too!  Valerie was a great Coach..  I'm also really enjoying the online games..####$$##%POSITIVE
I learning Portuguese beacause I've always wanted to be a enviromentalist in Brazil. It's awesome how fast RS teaches you words and useful everyday phrases.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been logging on during the language hours - several times during each day.  It makes no difference.  I have submitted a feature suggestion related to my last post as well - I think this is where the issue really is.  Either that, or I'm currently the only person in the world taking the Hebrew course right now...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Studio is awesome!!! First you'll need to get an online account. If your software was new (not a hand-me-down) then it probably came with some online time. If not you'll have to purchase a subscription. It's worth it!!  Get that account & log into Rosetta World! (It's on the bottom half of your learning software. You'll need to be connected to the internet.) There are all kinds of things to explore & participate in... reading stories, playing games by yourself or with others, and STUDIO!!!  Studio is a 50 minute class with a native speaker. They review everything you learned in your most recent unit. You'll recognize a lot of the pictures though some are new. And sometimes they play games. You're joined by 1-3 other learners. It's great! Definitely my favorite part of learning a new language!  Click on the studio button over to the right & then find a lesson to sign up for. Make sure you're in the correct unit!! Lessons are a little busy right now -- must be the new year. Good luck & have fun!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your help! I think RS is a great program and would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn another language. I believe that the assistance the program gives in pronounciation is invaluable.  It is the lack of grammarical teaching, more than the defining of words that I am having some difficulty with, which is what prompted the question.  I was not so much concerned with the actual meaning of the words as I was with when they were used, all the words seemed have the same purpose in the sentences.   Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Rosetta Stone for addressing my issues and giving a sincere apology where one was due!   I am looking forward to getting back to using this great program!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetti Stone:  the TOTALe experience I enjoy most is the Studio classes.  This way, I get a lot of experience speaking Spanish (Latin America).####$$##%POSITIVE
Sarah, Matt, and M Ichael:  what I meant was Rosetta Stone is the best way to learn or relearn a foreign language when one can't be in country.  Also, Rosetta Stone AND in country is the ABSOLUTE best way to learn or relearn a foreign language.  I don't miss a traditional classroom.####$$##%POSITIVE
I received the Spanish 1-5 package for Christmas from my husband, co I've only had it for one week. I'd taken one semester of Spanish at our local community college years ago, 2 years of French in high school and I understand alot of Spanish from listening to my Puerto Rican husband talk with his family. In only one week, I've gained alot and have begun to actually think in Spanish. I've caught myself even thinking about Spanish in my sleep! So from only one week of study, I think that this is the way to go. I can't wait to see what 3 months of study will bring.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am learning Spanish (Latin America) with Rosetta Stone.  I am making great progress especially with speaking Spanish that to the studio classes.  With Totale, I am learning how to read, speak, write, and understand Spanish.####$$##%POSITIVE
Before using Rosetta Stone I took Spanish in school.  I've been using Rosetta Stone's Spanish program since June of '09 and have never regretted buying it! I LOVE it! It is amazing how they can teach you a language without translation.  I bought all 5 levels and it has beem worth every penny! And their newest product is actually a really good deal because you get to practice online with natives and other learners so it really helps you to get out and speak after you learn it. Buy it. You will love it!####$$##%POSITIVE
He estudiado español solo tres meses (en realidad casi cuatro meses, pero esta mes no lo estudié en serio) y ahora peudo hablarlo, entenderlo, y mas importantemente, puedo usarlo.  En mi opinión, español no es demasiado dificil por un hablante de inglés. Por supuesto, Rosetta Stone es el mejor método.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am in my early 40's and never set foot in a Spanish class. I used other programs used various books. For example phrase books. In fact, i've aquired my own personal reference library. Although these things have helped me grow in the language as far as vocabulary, but RS has far supassed these regarding my learning experience. I must admit, that i wanted to aquire RS from the start, but, i Didn't have the means to aquire it. Therefore, i improvised and aquired the aforementioned.  Approximately 6 or so months ago, I bough (comprado) the RS program from a local Bookstore (Barnes and Noble). At the time i purchased the 3rd version, which is most of my experience. But, I recently upgraded to Totale (the latest edition of the program) and i am going back from my level 3 progress to the first level just to experience the new features. For example, i just read a story called "La Mujer en el Puente" (The woman on the bidge) When i read this story, which was written totally in Spanish, I almost cried. Anyway, I experienced fantastic customer service. I must tell you that the program prerequisites a high speed internet ISP. I suggest contacting customerservice so that you can be aware of the PC requirements.  I haven't even used the online features yet. I was told about the language games.  There are still more features that I haven't used yet.   As you can probably tell, my story is still unfolding, however, i can say that, i am enjoying the journey.  The reason i purchased the upgraded version is because i think the online games and interraction with the coaches and other learners will strongly contribute to my elevacation of confidence to speak to others. In a nutshell i thnk this program supasses any other language  learning tool that i've ever used.  I also sugguest acquiring a free newspaper and watching TV progams in the language. This will also help you,   If you decide to use RS . The more you expose yourself , you' ll find yourself understanding the dialogue bit by bit.  Personally, i'm not fluent in the language, but, i can see myself getting there. That won't happen until I begin interracting and practice speaking with others, but i think my shyness is gradually decreasing. I believe the use of this program will be very insrumental in the process.  Anyway this is my current experience. I hope this helps you.####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm still having the problem, but only when I access through the browser from the "upgraded" RS software.  Multiple tickets open but so far no word from technical support.  I checked my settings. They were all okay, but resetting them did not help. In Studio they said I sounded like a robot and I sent off to TS.  Have you tried a studio since you upgraded?####$$##%NEGATIVE
i called them...the thing you don't know is that the two computers are dead, so i couldnt uninstall them, but they gave me another activation####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christy.  Thanks for trying to help. I haven’t had any response from TS yet to my ticket/s. I followed all of your instructions. The settings were all fine, but I reset them anyway. It didn’t help at all. When I go on-line through my program by checking the box below my learner name that says “Open Rosetta Stone in my web browser”, (which takes me to totale.rosettastone.com to sign in) voice recognition works very poorly if at all, my voice recording is broken up and of poor quality and in studio they say I sound like a robot and take me out.  Voice recognition and voice recordings off-line in my program are normal.  If sign-in on line from rosettastone.com my voice recognition and studio work great and my voice recording is normal. How can I undo this “upgrade”?####$$##%NEGATIVE
i have taken all the Japanese courses that Rosetta Stone Totale offers. and it is such a great tool to use. To be able to talk to a native speaker really helps. Big improvement over v3!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Glenn!  I haven't used the Greek software, but I am using the Spanish (Latin American) product and I LOVE IT! This program is worth every penny and it is the best out there! I've even been told I speak Spanish without an accent!  Their course work is incredible as it teaches you how to speak, comprehend, read, write and use correct grammar without translation; the Studio sessions (Where you get to learn and practice with a live native tutor/coach) are incredibly helpful when it comes to needing to speak with natives of the language, and in Rosetta World you get to practice and play games with other learners and natives to help further sharpen all of your skills and you get to learn about the culture as well.  Here is the link to their Greek product where you can learn more about it: http://www.rosettastone.com/learn-greek####$$##%POSITIVE
But you can read both pinyin and simplified at the same time, right? Or switch back and forth easily? I'm guessing they made an exception for Mandarin because.. well.. it has thousands of characters [unless I'm mistaken] and RS is built in a way that you'll have many issues if you can't read what's written, but the chance of you being able to easily learn thousands of characters using RS is slim.  How about the writing lessons though? Only writing in pinyin, or do you have the choice of simplified?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I mean 1141!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please understand something,I dont feel like a victim because I purchased this ,I just feel like this isnt the system for me.I know NOTHING of spanish other than its my wifes first language and after being married to her for 5 years I thought maybe I should learn it for her sake.Ive never had a conversation with her parents or sisters and  using RS for 6 months I still cant say a sentance in spanish,I simply know randome SINGLE spanish words that I can barely spell.I do believe a person should know when to give up on something that isnt working and Im just about at that point.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've got the course and my progress back but lost all online access!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Spanish Spain. I have 2 languages, Spanish and French and since updating the Spanish I've been having problems.....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your solution did not work. NOT a happy customer!####$$##%NEGATIVE
hi lesie thank you for your response i do have a huge suggestion is sending the de-activation code to your servers as part of an easy de-activation process which will prevent a call and long wait time for Rosetta stone support. i had spent about an hr waiting in line on the web chat and phone just to had this taken care of yesterday evening.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I received a response from support informing me that I must use the version installed on my computer in order to access the individual activities.  However, it is very awkward to have to switch back and forth in order to take advantage of the individual activities as well as the online interaction.  I asked the support person to report this to IT as a problem in the update, and would request that the RS Success person who is monitoring this facebook page do the same.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They developed one, but it crashes every 2 minutes####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yea, that's basically what I meant. I knew you all had an app, but you're not exactly 'developing' it, and by that I mean it  1) Is not compatible with most devices and 2) Doesn't work for the devices it's 'compatible' for.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone- Why does it crash every 3 minutes on the dot on my galaxy s2 android 4.0?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your address came back as undeliverable.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta stone is a fraud.   And you must be too...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Afraid I don't agree with you.  Rosetta Stone is working for me except I would like to have a little formal grammar assistance.####$$##%POSITIVE
just im traveling there once or twice a year and turkey is our nice neighbour ( i live in IRAN) its really pleasant learning with roseta stone;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I've already logged every error, I did it months ago. Still no update to the app####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi and thanks for the feedback. It doesn't work, it still automatically directs me to the .de website. Great if it could be possible to change that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
...but we don't really care either way...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I believe this to be the lamest response I've ever received on anything, anywhere.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Here's the thing. I have checked your various sites and people have been making this complaint since at least November 2011 and there hasn't been any progress so I doubt that your appreciation is ginuine...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Exactly this blog post dates back to November 2011. I'll just buy the iPhone since the rest of the phones you have listed since LAST year aren't up to date or on the Sprint contract.####$$##%NEGATIVE
same here but my uninstalled itself ....dont know if I should reinstall it or what ??? hope I dont loose my progress####$$##%NEGATIVE
es muy divertido hablar con alguien y me entienden! Algunos de los muchachos que son de la cultura española parece increíble que yo pueda hablar y escribir con tanta facilidad! Voy a continuar mis estudios y compartir mis conocimientos con mis amigos y familiares. Gracias Lauren para su responce. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
HA! Ive got 4 WEEKS with no attempt at product support from Rosetta Stone! Some of the worst customer service this side of Bank of America.  GOOD LUCK!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay.  I received the email.  I have attempted on line chat 4 times and no one picks up.  Also, when I phoned the tech said there is a $19 fee for support.  I am having problems with speech recognition.  Many times the program does not respond at all to what I say.  I have a few other things, is it best if I phone in?####$$##%NEGATIVE
well I didn't want it to be public , I'm a native speaker of Arabic and found this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u386h3619QA####$$##%NEGATIVE
you should try it....it really works. Necesitas tratarlo.......en serio funciona.####$$##%POSITIVE
I had a lot of problems with voice recognition and speaking in Studios after the upgrade. TS2 finally called me back, took over my computer and fixed the problem. It has worked well ever since.####$$##%POSITIVE
.: Wait until you get "Fatal Application Error"####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes, I had lots of trouble. After a few days RS uninstalled itself from my computer - at least that is what it looks like to me, a non-techy. RS tech help helped re-install RS but it is the original version. Each daay I sign on I am asked if I want to install the update and each day I click "remind me later"####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you for the awesome and quick response!####$$##%POSITIVE
No, but I had lots of trouble with the last Irish Games Night.  There were only two other participants and both kept losing their connections.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Shouldn't RS start coding in HTML5?  RS seems behind the times with being "flash" only.  Flash won't work with the new mobile devices and RS should work with them.  Unfortunately RS is all flash.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't remember now, but if I had to click the terms and conditions to see what the offer was, I may have done that, but I do not remember anything asking or advising me that anything would be posted on my behalf, I look for that.   You know, honestly, if I bought Rosetta Stone and liked it I would have no problem at all with sharing it. What I found so offensive about this latest marketing push was that you offer a great deal, the person clicks the link and then it posts to their wall that they've tried it and apparently to friend's walls as well. Without asking if it is OK to do that. Most apps, etc ask for your permission to do anything like that, it is not hidden.  I worked in online advertising for a few years and yes you will get more clickthroughs with "tricky stuff" like that, but I think your conversions are going to suffer. Also, you'll go from being a high end, desired, product to another internet "back alley pusher", which is not what I think you guys want to do. I know you need eyes to sell product, but don't get them at the expense of your reputation.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I deleted it but will see if it is still on any friends' walls.  Meanwhile, this link does NOT ask permission for mass posting, nor does it warn.  I was led to believe it would simply send me an email, and I wrongly assumed my friend on whose wall I saw the link intentionally shared it.  This is amateurish stuff and embarrassing for your company.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Too much of that going on####$$##%NEGATIVE
Have had that happen.  It sucks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well that part is good news, but again, this doesn't address the issue of why my clicking on it caused it to appear on friends' walls.  Very spammy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You're as evasive as Romney.  You're supposed to be asked permission when clicking a link before it posts on your behalf.  Any link that does not warn you that the next thing that happens is an ad on the wall is spammy.  Case closed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, I just checked.  I see no way of opting out. The help screens I viewed say the opposite.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ed it disconnects at both and o not remember an error message####$$##%NEGATIVE
The connectiio to your server is drops in the middle of almost all my sessions####$$##%NEGATIVE
Or you can respect I do not want your junk on my page why must I change something for you like I said before I have never tried your item and do not even know what it is but I do not like you posting on my page or telling my friends I like you####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just stop posting on my page that is all do you not have any kind of respect for people ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nice buck-passing there, RS. Lame.####$$##%NEGATIVE
unfortunately, we can't :( I'd sure wish I could just block you!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
This was in regard to that dumb "claiming an offer" bs that spammed a post under my account just because I was sent an email. I've never even liked your page on here so I'm not sure why I was emailed in the first place.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks a lot! that seemed to resolve the issue.  I appreciate you taking the time to help me out :) Have a great day Christy!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I've always found customer service great...####$$##%POSITIVE
So its still $400...that is not even a good deal :/####$$##%NEGATIVE
well then i shall find a way to advertise on your wall something you competitor sells what is it you sell####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, Facebook finally removed the post. I don't know why it took several hours and 10 "Remove" clicks to do it - probably because they wanted to advertise without permission for just a little longer.  If you care about your business's image, you should end your relationship with Facebook. This is really sketchy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah, that's way out of a college student's price range.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone you are wrong. I can resell my computer games if I want on Ebay. There is no copyright problem with selling my original copy of Scrabble 2009 edition. Or selling a copy of any music CD's that I own. Why exactly is Rosetta Stone different? Why do I not have a right to sell my copy of Rosetta Stone? Why do you effectually destroy the second hand market and defame sellers by accusing them of selling fake software?####$$##%NEGATIVE
The error code is 2125. Homeschool Edition. Version 3. Purchased in April ago, installed 3 months ago, died a couple weeks later.  We were hoping to use for the fall semester. Tried the various delete tracking.db3, run, let it check for updates, restore the data tricks... won't work after restoring the tracking.db3 file.  Looks like this has been a long-running issue. http://codecorner.grumpynut.com/index.php?blog=7&p=156&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 (from 2010!)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hello! I am having this same issue....can you help me too?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am having the same issue. Could you please contact me too? Thank you####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hello Christy and Rachel... I'm also having problems with the 5611 error####$$##%NEGATIVE
seems like quite a few people are having this issue myself included perhaps support could post the solution on the page...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Then supplement it.  RS is good to get conversationally fluent - I used it after taking classes at the university in German.  I have taken classes in Italian and Portuguese and am now working on RS to gain confidence in speaking.  RS is a tool, and like any tool, you have to know how to use it to get the most out of it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Our school uses this as our Spanish class. It's boring. The pictures can be confusing. If it had English translation in there and it actually explained how to use the grammar, it'd be 800x better. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
DO you mean just the online subscription?  If you do, I think that it is excellent reinforcement.  I finished all 5 levels of German and used it extensively.  There are stories and games in the language utilizing the vocabulary that you learned in the program.  Also, you can have classes with native speakers of the language.  I must have had about 50 or them!  Now, I practice with people over SKYPE and in person.  It really made a difference because I had to use the language.  If I cannot use the language - speak it - for me, it is not worth learning it.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Cindy - I bought the CDs, and just extended the online portion.  THe online sections made a world of difference!!  Make sure that you take as many studios as you can!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rosemary,  thank you!  my new ref # is 1418387.  I am going to try support again right now, if things don't work out I would really appreciate a call from you.  THANKS AGAIN   I love Rosetta and can't wait to get back on the program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much!  I just got off the phone and I think the problem is resolved.  What is the purpose in the new update?####$$##%POSITIVE
I have used Pimsleur and have it for several languages.  I find it more useful to listen to in the car or when doing something.  I can't just sit and listen.  RS is good for me because it engages more senses and the studio sessions are fantastic!  I have used Pimsleur for reinforcement.  I have also used rocketlangages.com which is all online but has voice recognition and downloadable games.  You pay one price, and get all the updates free of charge.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS can give a strong base - especially for speaking and understanding.  It pushed me to a different level in German and gave me more confidence in dealing with the language.  Even if you take a university class, you need reinforcement to truly feel comfortable in the language.####$$##%POSITIVE
A free trial? From Rosetta Stone? No such thing, hun. You have to give them hundreds of bucks for the privilege of being asked to subscribe to their services.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Should you have said 'domo arigato'??  :p LOVE it when companies actually provide quality customer service! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
You're supposed to figure it out from the pictures, just like learning a language naturally.  Kinda frustrating, though . . .####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hello John Cunyus Si I'm learning it I'm sticking to the course it just after you lose a few words hear and there then a few more i get a little scared. I love the method it is starting to move around my head one day soon it will start rolling of my tongue####$$##%POSITIVE
Todavía me aparece!####$$##%NEGATIVE
And it will be swiftly rejected because Rosetta Stone is trying to make MONEY not help people learn things.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i did and as i said i do not know anything about you so how can you post on my wall and worst on my friends saying i like u####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ah Tan, you're realizing how money hungry Rosetta Stone is. That's why they updated their software to force you to go to a browser and have an in your face advertisement asking if you want a subscription before you're able to use your software. Adding SPAM to your name is NOT a good business tactic. How about some full disclosure on how much more money you are making due to this? (Remember, spammers do it because it is very profitable.)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree I never liked it either ####$$##%NEGATIVE
It worked!!!!  :D  Omg, thank you SO MUCH!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
have been calling else help number for five days and transferred 1000 times and having got the first piece of help just been listening to a lot of elevator music and advertisements now I just want my money back####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just called the phone number again but I chose the option to act like I wanted to buy something and at least the girl answered this time was honest enough to tell me that your customer support port is not actually a part of Rosetta Stone and is not very good in that I had little or no chance of getting any help over the phone I do appreciate her honesty. your companies should change the message they give you when you're on hold about how important your customers are because that is definitely not the case once you've spent money####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for responding. The representative I spoke with was not that helpful. just confirming I was able to get the homeschool version instead shipped?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for responding! Love your software.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like it a lot, and it enabled me to use a different computer for a studio session, thereby solving a sound problem!####$$##%POSITIVE
It is a scam! I have had it a year and the training is good. But once your online subscription has expired, the program locks up! No Support what-so-ever!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love Totale.  I really love the stories.  I'm always so surprised how much I can comprehend just listening or just reading. And the games are so much fun!  I'm starting Level 4 tonight.  Can't wait!####$$##%POSITIVE
They answered me yesterday kindly informing me that three months of online access comes with the program.  After that, you're welcome to give us more money for access....  I wouldn't go so far as to say "scam", my version still works afterward but it is damned inconvenient when you don't have time to access the features only to be told fork over yet more money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They charge for the online portion after three months of free service.  The studios are well worth the money ($75 for 6 months) if you actually use it.  It helped me speak the languages, though I already was exposed to grammar in university courses.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would likely agree that Studio and Rosetta World are of merit and worthy of a monthly subscription fee, if one wants to dive that deep... However, the product is misleading in marketing, as they portray the $400-$500 packaged product as usable on home pc and iPad, as Rosetta Course, though in order to use Rosetta Course on iPad, you must pay an outrageous subscription fee.  I have suggested they offer iPad Rosetta Course free for those who have purchased the package and segment Studio/World as subscription based as they are now. I have seen an enormous amount of complaints of potential customers that will not purchase because of the subscription fees for iPad.  But, as I was told, "the app is free! We don't charge $1.99!". Wow!####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, that's NOT possible. If it was just me, I might consider that I had accidentally clicked a link. Once. The Facebook help topic you keep linking to clearly states that you click the text that says "Claim Offer" in order to get the offer. I was never interested to see your terms and conditions. I would imagine that the 2 or 3 deceased persons who have "claimed" your offer did not click, like, or do anything related to your page. Stop lying. Stop using unethical advertising tactics.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You aren't getting it. This is clearly something YOUR company is doing. There are hundreds, count them, of people asking that you stop this practice. This does not happen with other companies. We did not endorse your product and trying to claim that it is just how Facebook works is at best a serious misunderstanding on your part.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Eric.  Unfortunately you and your company seem to miss the point, namely being mislead by packaging, advertising, online assistance and as recently as a social webinar today, portraying the use of the iPad app Rosetta Course as travel access to the app licensing you already paid for with the packaged version for PC.  You even stated it yourself above: TOTALe, consisting of Studio and World.... All I am asking is Course (which is what I paid for packaged, with the expectation of the iPad usage) be separate regarding the subscription fee for service.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stones customer service is by far the worst EVER!!!  I have unanswered technical issues, been tossed all around India, and on hold for hours!  I am so disappointed with this purchase, which was not cheap.  My kids will continue to learn in their schools.  Thankfully I am still able to get a refund.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Glad you could get your money back! I think that the word should get out about this company. That will be the only way they will change! If I had known about the online fees, I never would have bought the program. They advertise this as part of the plus' of the software, but do not explain up front that there is a continuing change for the online community! Typical of this generations batch of lying corporate executives!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I know I won't consider buying it now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have spent 2 1/2 hours of my personal time on the phone today alone.  And the issue is still unresolved.  Rosetta Stones is very inefficient when it comes to resolving technical issues, especially one as simple as mine.  I'm beyond my point of being patient today.  Rather than emailing me fix my account, which you apparently know if you are emailing me.  If its not fixed by this evening I will be returning it for my full refund.  Thank you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried that and couldn't get a hold of anyone.  So I came here.  Thank you though!####$$##%NEGATIVE
no, it's just really slow and it's not recognizing the correct sounds when I speak them.  I know I'm hearing it correctly but it's being a little finicky.####$$##%NEGATIVE
some shady marketing tactics to boost sales I'm sure... it may have come from other facebook apps that post things on your behalf but RS is obviously and ultimately responsible for this because they are the only one who benefits from it. This crap drives me crazy, slippery slope Rosetta Stone... very slippery.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just reinstalled my older version of 4.0 - and it forces me to update to 4.5. I have no choice. So, if you update to 4.5, you have lost all your progress. I can't find a fix. You must remove your "products.xml" progress file and the program creates a new one. You have to reinstall all of your languages and start over.  Then, once you start all over with 4.5, you will have a hard time creating a new learner because you have to register the learner online and so far, the program is not connecting to the Rosetta Stone servers properly. So I can't use the program at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The Version installs, but it wont recognize the language CD.  It keeps telling me to insert the CD.  The computer recognizes that it is there, but the software can't seem to find it.  Has this ever happened before?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love Rosetta Stone!####$$##%POSITIVE
You sure must hate Canadians, I keep getting promotional offers from you but none apply to me. So can't buy by installments, can't get free shipping and all the promos only apply to the US. Not really impressed, this is probably why your economy is in the tank due to a maniacal dictator in power...####$$##%NEGATIVE
My Dear Rosetta,  I never 'liked' you, but I get annoying messages that say 'so-and-so likes Rosetta Stone', and it fills me with sadness.####$$##%NEGATIVE
¡obtener el infierno fuera de las noticias, Rosetta Stone!####$$##%NEGATIVE
reboot, check the clock, check the firewall, uninstall, reinstall. Working great. Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have been trying to get hold of your customer support team 4 times in the past 3 days, each time i was given different reasons to why they are unavailable. Today i was finally told that i can speak to someone but i have been on hold now for more than 1 hour, still cant get through to anyone!####$$##%NEGATIVE
i ordered on the 2nd it went to backorder on the 5th..wow####$$##%NEGATIVE
still waiting on that message...:/####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thom, did you ever recieve your product? I ordered mine Monday with "overnight delivery" and too dont even have a tracking number!!! With no help from customer service either!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was thinking about purchasing this but I'm not so sure now. Thanks Roger####$$##%NEGATIVE
Get them to tell you about the "free" ipad app, that you have to pay a subscription fee to access the courseware you already saved $350 on by spending $399.  How do you say "free" in 47 other languages...  don't know, I can't afford the recurring debt.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You just said it AGAIN ... it was NOT $749 last year ... that exact same add has been coming to my inbox since Fall 2010 ... When a product is "on sale" for two years that price becomes the real price of the product, no matter how you try to spin it!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im at 25 minutes now!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried; no response so far####$$##%NEGATIVE

I was using Italian without problems all week, tried to download and use French today and now I can't even use the Italian.####$$##%NEGATIVE
still not working! I ve tried all the steps, though not everything pups up as the video shows... keeps asking me for update or telling me about the error #2124. I tried to set up for online support but are the schedules central time? I live in Mexico so I need to know , and also you only have tech sup while I am at work! so whats next? I ve read many comments about the same problem and I feel really disappointed with your program####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much, the video solved everything! starting French now : ) merci beaucoup####$$##%POSITIVE
I tried to follow all the steps but the program is not responding, I dont know if I have to uninstal my first language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree. I ordered a week ago and still NO ONE can tell me confirmation about the product. I go to the online order status, and it doesnt even work! ugh!!! I'm pretty sure if I dont hear anything monday, Im returning it####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was indeed solved and thank you so much! Gracias!####$$##%POSITIVE

58 minutes on the line and counting...####$$##%NEGATIVE
If you are not lazy, do not try the Rosetta Stone method. Their so called method is supposed to teach you languages in a natural, just like how children learn, but you think about it! It takes years for a child to learn a language and even after they have learnt it from their parents, they make a lot of mistakes speaking. So just go get a reliable textbook that teaches you the grammar right from the beginning, learn the grammar, learn new vocab, and you will be good to go. Once you know how to use the right grammar, you can have confidence when you speak, you will get the accent quickly after you know the grammar, just try to pronounce things the way a native speaker does. Follow this method I am telling you, I learned English this way, and Spanish, I am studying languages, the next languages I am going to learn are Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Sanskrit, and the Avestan language.   RosettaStone is an entertainment, not a good educational tool.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I hear your frustration! I love the rosetta course and think highly of the method but since the update I have a number of issues with the new website.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ive been using firefox ill try the flash player but half of the time the website wont even load up####$$##%NEGATIVE
It has been; thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
bless you! Thanks so much! Gracis!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey!!! That worked! Thankssss sooo much!!! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Help!!!   Now the screen freezes and eventually crashes whenever I go into Rosetta World.the message says that flash plug in crashed. I added flash 11 to a laptop running vista. But I see it is happening on a different laptop with windows 7 operating system. Is anyone else having this problem? what happened to suddenly cause this problem?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Christy, Earlier this month you solved the problem with the splash screen freezing whenever I tried to open the program with the icon or in program files. The next day when I turned on the computer it started happening all over again. So I've ended up just using the program online. A bit disappointing.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for your suggestions. I am working with tier 2 now who has temporarily resolved the problem. It is working in Chrome with a airmessages to go past.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for explicit directions for using games. this would be helpful for other learners to know as well. It would be great if Rosetta would offer a social online for using the new updated site instead of still running the old video with the old website. Do you think you might pass that on to the appropriate personnel?####$$##%POSITIVE
I can't even get someone to tell me when they are shipping the order that that have the temerity to have begun charging me for.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Leslie,  I need to know if it will work on my computer.  I am not wasting another two hours on tech support.  Why do you not have a tech support department that knows what they are talking about?  For that matter, why am I holding for two hours to get an answer?  Did the customer service office have an evacuation?  And, per my first note,  I still do not have a number to speak to a real live person.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree, I should not have ordered their product!!  I'm fuming with there customer service!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
By the way, I went through all 5 levels of German and it helped me speak German better than before.  It got rid of my Angst!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Janice and Edward you are a big help. Thanks again.####$$##%POSITIVE
I actually like Rosetta Stone and the method...I like to know more than what it gives. That's why I'm looking for the grammar book to go along with the Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
It's help a lot when I'm at my sons soccer games and listening to the parents####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm with you.  I think the Better Business Bureau is the way to go.  Truly a disgraceful company.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree, I should not have ordered their product!! I'm fuming with there customer service!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Their customer Service is a disaster. a terrible disaster. you want to talk to them, God have mercy on you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have heard they do not even tell you they have not shipped the product BUT they do take the money immediately. Not a ethical business practice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Merle is the totale spanish website working for you? it seems to be down every day for me####$$##%NEGATIVE
Similar problem for me. They obviously have deleted or blocked my post. Be careful Armin, they will lie to you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why are you advertising overnight shipping when you don't even have the product in stock? Refund my money and let me know when it's available and perhaps I'll order it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree i've been trying every day to use their new totale website that they converted to and it NEVER works! you pay so much money for all this and half of the program doesn't even work. so I can't play any of the games or talk with a native speaker or anyone else learning the language I can only do the lessons on the CDs. Not a happy customer either!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah I'm dealing with the same thing. I ordered mine Spetmeber 4th, and get told it will be sent out Wednesday, then Thursday, Then Friday, etc. I can't believe that such an upstanding company has awful customer service!!! If I don't hear anything today with the "promised" email, I am canceling####$$##%NEGATIVE
You bring out the best in us Simy, that was indeed a fun class, thank you :) x####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't accept.an offer  please get me off tne site####$$##%NEGATIVE
35 minutes later, I did talk to a person that told me my order (that I thought was overnight shipping because that was what I was told) is really on back order. A simple email from your company would of saved 45 of my cell phone minutes & my time. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Hunter,  Thanks for your reply.  If I have questions, perhaps I can ask them here instead of "Live Chat" or by e-mail.  I'm used to pretty much instantaneous help systems with other applications.  Not so with RS.   I have a few examples of RS glitches with support but no need to go into them here.  I appreciate your offer of assistance for the future.  I am very happy with the learning system thus far and had my first studio session today.  I'll see about the help/support in the future.  By the way, is their a Rosetta Stone Community Forum?####$$##%POSITIVE
@ Christine, The FaceBook support has been far superior to Live Chat and e-mail support.  Based on my experience, I am not recommending Live Chat.  Took forever to connect.  Then, my support person transferred me to another person.  Screen told me someone was there but no one ever conversed with me during that time.  I kept waiting and waiting.  No luck.  Then, I sent an e-mail.  It took quite a few days to get a reply etc.  I resolved my own issues after awhile.  Guess that's what is expected with the delays.  @ Hunter,  I am very happy with your responsiveness and I'll use FB in the future.  Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Okay thank you very much for your help####$$##%POSITIVE
Just thought I’d add a quick reply (hope you don’t mind).  As someone who’s had the French course for around four or five months now, I can highly recommend it.  I’ve tried learning through books (several), dictionaries, MP3 sets (two lots) and even flash cards... I spent a lot of money and none have worked nearly as well as Rosetta Stone, not even close, and it’s by far the best I’ve ever used (I just wish I’d bought it years ago).  Plus there’s also a six month money back guarantee, so there’s nothing really to lose either...  Personally I’m just glad that I’ve found something that finally works and that’s enjoyable and great fun too... It’s worth a try... x####$$##%POSITIVE
That would be brilliant, thank you so much :o) Rosetta Stone's been working perfectly so far, and I just read somewhere that it may be to do with my Anti-virus Software... Anyhow, hopefully it's a quick fix once I know what to do... With many thanks, Cx####$$##%POSITIVE
That's brilliant... all resolved and working well (a simple fix once I knew how) thank you Christy for the link and the swift response.####$$##%POSITIVE
I would appreciate your help.  I never got the PM from you####$$##%NEGATIVE
got it solved. thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
Unlike####$$##%NEGATIVE
Don't send this to me any more....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Seriously? The most "recognizable" part of Mumbai is a laborer pulling a cart with Western looking tourists? Or someone talking their way out of a legal jam in Portugal? These ads don't just "strike me" as stereotypical. Your response duly acknowledges that they are ... a lesson in diversity seems to be the need if the hour. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed.  The support of this product is hideous.  The only company I've ever met with worse support is Dell, and they are practically legendary.  But give me two more go-arounds with Rosetta Stone, and I'd might put them in the same camp.####$$##%NEGATIVE
In trying to receive technical support over the phone, I was told I would have to pay an additional $19.99 because I purchased the product a year ago. This is the first time I have called for technical support. I paid $481.95 - in full - and THIS is how Rosetta Stone treats their customers. Wow!####$$##%NEGATIVE
it says 5611.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm loving it! Just wish I could pronounces the words better >_<####$$##%POSITIVE
Experiencing the same issue over here! So frustraiting.####$$##%NEGATIVE
OK so if John won't answer then could you help me? I'm on the phone again. Going on over two hours trying to resolve this and I can't get online support either.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm having a 2123 error and my BIG problem is no one will help me over the phone without my paying an additional $19.99!!! I've not asked for technical support before. Seems like it would be included with the $481.95 I spent!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Stacy, give me a chance....lol  :-)  My 13 year old was stressed out about her Spanish class so I did what most dads do. I tried to solve the problem and ease her stress.  To start with, your sales rep lied/misled me about the arrival date of the product.  I was told if I ordered now that I would recieve the discount and free overnight shipping.  I was promised a delivery for the next day.    Your program arrived over 10 days later! The story at Rosetta Stone is that it was on backorder. A few days later I inquried again and I was told that Spanish Latin America is one of the most popular programs and they always have it in stock.  Then after a brief hold I was told that it was backordered.  Now you tell me!  Shouldn't a company who specializes in communication be better at communicating?  Or, was I lied to just to get my business?  After finally receiving the product I install it and am presented with an information screen.  No problem!  I don't have an issue with activating the product and giving out my personal information.  But when it started asking for my daughters info that's where I drew the line. We have strict rules about what info goes out over the internet when it comes to our kids.  I contacted chat support to see what I could do about the "nag screen" asking for personal information. I got this for my daughter and I don't want her to have to provide her personal info to learn a new language. I was completely OK with the language CD's.  I asked support how to stop the "nag screen" and they couldn't tell me. A "Nag Screen" is a way of forcing you to enter your information before you can use the product.  I asked at last 6 times and the lady didn't get it. I asked her to go get someone who understood my question and she wouldn't do it. It's like she was afraid she'd be penalized for asking how to solve a problem.   I wasted over 3 hours dealing with this and other support issues. Your phone support has unbelievably long hold times so you force us to chat with people whose first language is NOT English. My heart goes out to them because I know they're trying, but it doesn't do me any good. You can also tell that the chat support are attending to multiple people at one time. They take FOREVER to respond to the simplest of questions.  All together I've wasted 6 hours purchasing, following up on arrival dates, chatting with tech support, waiting on hold for tech support, and going to the post office to return it to you. This venture has cost me more in time than I paid for your product.  I will find another way to resolve the issue with my daughter's Spanish class.   Rosetta Stone has been a huge disappointment.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry to hear about that Stacy.  I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that call.  They seem to speak one language and one language only...."PROFIT"  It looks like they replaced "CUSTOMER SERVICE1.1" with PROFIT 4.0.  I've read where they're going to replace "TOO BAD 2.4" with "APATHY 3.0" next.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, but too little, too late.  Good of you to address part of the problem though.  I've already returned the product.  Couldn't see wasting anymore time on hold or dealing with your frustrating chat support.    My only goal in posting here was to save someone else the pain I went through.  However, after coming to your page I see that I'm too late.  It looks like there are a LOT of people who are experiencing the same issues I was dealing with.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jeffery took care of the problem. He was quite proficient. I am glad to have this resolved!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks, but I have to work tomorrow and there is no one here to accept the "third" and final delivery attempt from UPS . Hence  I see it getting shipped back. What a hassel.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Same thing happened to me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No bueno.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Same thing here! Ugggg!####$$##%NEGATIVE
i do have another question, when i get a question wrong it doesn't tell me why, just has me guess again####$$##%NEGATIVE
still on hold####$$##%NEGATIVE
What about a 2123 error? And how does Rosetta Stone propose to replace the HOURS of our time that they have squandered...after receiving $481.95 from my family budget? This is horrible!####$$##%NEGATIVE
puchased Chinese level 1 july 17, 2010, went through most levels and then stopped. Began using again recently (from the start), and had problems. called for assistance (ref# 1893578 - reinstalled). Product worked for a while, but had a new screen for homeschool which I did not recall from before. Had problems again, reinstalled again, but cannot get beyond Level 2??? and the homeschool page continues.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hunter, I did the instruction and its still doing the same thing.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They still did not solve my problem. tech support tried a couple of things and then gave up on me. He didnt say a word just disconnected the chat.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Allison- keep trying- eventually you get somewhere - but you are right- they need to do something about their customer support.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well I have tried multiple times and got no where. But apparently I'm not the only one who has this issue. I've viewed reviews online and apparently many many customers have a problem with their "customer support"####$$##%NEGATIVE
I DO NOT LIKE IT!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you again!####$$##%POSITIVE
i'm alaina's mom! i tried the online sampler at www.rosettastone.com and it was FUN. we will have latin and spain spanish in our home within 2 weeks. can't wait to start the program(s)!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's true! I had taken a few years in high school and all of that paled in comparison to my first week of Rosetta Stone. Now what they should do is bring this software into the schools. This is so much more effective.####$$##%POSITIVE
And Earl, it's nothing like a class. You make the connections yourself in the same way that you learned your first language. I was really surprised by how well I was catching on and I was never really that great in any of my foreign language classes. If you're interested in learning, it's definitely beneficial to try it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Its physically broken####$$##%NEGATIVE
No it didn't help it still cost to much####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good Rosetta Stone  es  lo mejor .####$$##%POSITIVE
es un tremendo programa saludos####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much, Rain! If only they would have told me that! I will do this and follow-up.  I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate that.  Once we get this resolved, I will post a positive follow-up.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Trudy,  I'm happy to hear that you are enjoying learning Spanish with Rosetta Stone. I have also studied Spanish (Latin America) with RS and love it! What is your favorite part of Rosetta Stone so far?  ¡Buena suerte con tu nuevo idioma! -Aarón####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is not worth the money you pay for it. I got it for Mandarin Chinese and was extremely disappointed. I found a product called Rocket Languages which is A LOT cheaper and actually works.####$$##%NEGATIVE
In my opinion, RS is great if you already have some background in the language.  I took it for German and now for Italian and Portuguese.  It helps you really SPEAK the language.  If you need to start from scratch, you porbably need a college class or a product that will explain everything to you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Dont tell me you dont have people  how are programmers @ your company,U can always fix this unepected post by youselves before someone who didnt like your page sees it.What   you must know is, people do appreciate what they like by their own will , not what someone pushed them to like .That is, If you do not fix this you will always receive insults  from people.It is the world of ICT you know  you can fix this problem immediately for goodness of your business. What if  it will comeback on my page?  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im studing ESL HEALTH CARE , TO TAKE TOEFL AND  CGFNS EXAMS TO GET MY NURSING LICENSE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS HELPING TO TALK MORE ENGLISH WHEN IT IS REVIEWING CONSTANTLY MY PRONUNCIATION AND I FEEL VERY CONFORTABLE AND HAPPY USING ROSSETA STONE I THINK THIS IS THE BEST METHOD TO CORRECT TO ME COMPLETLY  AND NO GETTING STREES  OR SLEEPY WHEN IM  LEARNING ENGLISGH LIKE A SECOND LENGUAGE THANKS A LOT AGAIN####$$##%POSITIVE
I think it should be cheaper too, but the price is set by demand. If they decreased the price, it's still possible for them to lose revenue.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just make sure .I got a message from Rosetta Stone.I don't understand how I ended to your web site.I saw messages in my facebook.say sign in .My emailaddress.I don't want  anything to do with it please.Sincerely yours Maria Hall####$$##%NEGATIVE
You learn loads and very quickly but you get out what you put in. You need to actually use it as it is intended and use all the tools they provide. Supplementing by actually talking in your new language and trying to think in it too will leap you forward to conversational fluency. If you are the type of person who can absorb grammar from a book or website then do that too to help you understand why. And watch loads and loads of TV or films in your new language...... It really is a good program. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Honestly? Not much.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Honestly, quite a lot if you use other things to reinforce your learning - something that you would have to do with any language-learning tool if you really want to speak and understand.  There are a lot of resources on the internet to help you.  The best part of RS are the games and the studio sessions.  AFter 8 semesters of German, I knew a lot, but was afraid to speak.  That appears to be a problem with a lot of people who are learning a new language.  AFter 5 levels of German, I don't have as much Angst as I did and am speaking with native speakers every week via SKYPE or in person.  RS is a great tool to get you conversationally fluent - with supplements.####$$##%POSITIVE
can you offer any discounts or offers , just seems a shame that the same product is £70 more expensive . Is a little unfair , don't you agree?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please do!! I've been requesting it since 2009 :( very disappointing####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am using the online monthly software right now.  Loving it!  <3####$$##%POSITIVE
He was a life saver very helpful!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I know I can PURCHASE this access but when I bought it I was told I would have 12 months of access for free with my purchase of the CD-ROMs.  It was misrepresented to me during the purchase which is why I'm upset.  When I pay $400 for something, I expected a little more to come with it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have no messages either in FB or my personal email####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've always had great customer support. Maybe depends on type of problem.####$$##%POSITIVE
I find it interesting that several people jumped on this yesterday saying they would help and still today there is no help.####$$##%NEGATIVE
rosetta stone is the best####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!  I'm having a blast with it, trying to use it (in my head, at least) as much as I can.  Ik hou van Nederlands!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't mind seeing posts FROM Rosetta Stone with updates and news about products. What upsets me is the posts that - unknowing by me - get sent out to my friends advertising Rosetta Stone. They do not appear in my news feed, but my friends send me messages asking me to stop sending your advertisements. I am not sending them. You are sending them with my name.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Rain, I successfully deactivate the product on the computer. It gave me as described in the link u sent me the two codes : Activation code and Deactivation code.  Now can you kindly provide me the e-mail adress of the support team for that i could send it to them to complete the deactivation process ?  --BR####$$##%POSITIVE
Activation and Deactivation code E-mailed Rosetta Stone Success I'm now waitting for your feed-back to go and install it on the new computer.  - I appreciate your assistance..####$$##%POSITIVE
I just come to install it on the new computer and it work fine.  Thanks for the quick support and long life to Rosetta Stone products...####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you so much! I'm living in montreal and desperate to learn a little french!####$$##%POSITIVE
wow! that was so easy! thank you so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks so much that was a big help!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone...####$$##%POSITIVE
I love it!...I did French too. You seem to learn a lot quite quickly and it tends to 'stick' in your brain.... Are you doing RS too Jill?####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm a big fan to be honest and would always recommend it. Like I said, Spanish is my second language I've learnt with RS and probably won't be the last! ;)####$$##%POSITIVE
I speak Spanish, I'm happy because I finished the course of this program English.. ohhh siiiiii####$$##%POSITIVE
GREAT WAY TO LEARN!####$$##%POSITIVE
ese programa es maravilloso lorrie,se aprende muy facil####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
I actually called and ended up purchasing the full French and Korean packs. I just have to say that the woman who helped me was exceptionally helpful!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for getting back to me I actually just spoke with a customer service representative and ended up purchasing your Korean and French full set. She was so helpful!!a####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I just started using it. I like it EXCEPT for the writing lessons. It uses a Cyrillic keyboard that somewhat corresponds to the sounds of the English keyboard layout. HOWEVER, it is completely different from the keyboard layout that Windows (and the rest of the world) uses. If you do an image search for Cyrillic keyboard layout you get a zillion images of the Windows Russian layout. Doing the writing lessons, you can't help but learn the wrong keyboard layout.####$$##%NEGATIVE
In the writing lessons on Rosetta Stone, they have an on-screen keyboard of Cyrillic letters. You can either mouse click on the letters you need to enter or push the corresponding key on your QWERTY keyboard. Rosetta Stone has the letters laid out sort of corresponding to the sound the Cyrillic letter makes. For example the Cyrillic y sounds like u, so the QUERTY u makes the Cyrillic y. That's fine. However, when you then go to Microsoft Word or your email or any other program and use the Windows Cyrillic keyboard, it is a completely different layout than the one Rosetta Stone uses. I really like Rosetta Stone. I've bought and used all five levels of three different languages. But this is a flaw in the program. It's like learning to type all over again, and then learning all over again. But overall, the software is worth its price. I haven't tried the Russian online stuff yet. Spanish online is great, both games and sessions. French is pretty much limited to the sessions with tutors as nobody seems to ever play the games.But the sessions are very good.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hey, you can choose which layout you want to use, phonetic or Windows. It's easy to switch. Get the Russian!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have Rosetta Stone and the support stinks I can't access V3 since they made me buy TotalE  No help no support####$$##%NEGATIVE
Product might be great if you could access but NO SUPPORT####$$##%NEGATIVE
Don't buy unless you know their support sucks####$$##%NEGATIVE
Lisa, I have Chinese version three and Korean Totale. I had some issues with my version three, but I used the online support chat and they were able to quickly resolve my issue. Have you tried starting a chat visa the Rosetta Stone website?####$$##%POSITIVE
omg that  would be awsome ! ty####$$##%POSITIVE
Brilliant session, thank you Simy! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Jonathan! I've also tried that but still i keep getting the error.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That was easy! Thanks so much. Fantastic.####$$##%POSITIVE
The French keyboard was off by a few keys, but it was fairly easy to adapt. The Cyrillic is completely different!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Amazing system - I wish I hadn't waited so many years to start!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you but I did the support chat and they helped me get it going, other than terrible installation and launch instructions for a Mac...the program itself is wonderful. I don't feel like I'm memorizing I feel like I'm actually learning it!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you, it worked very well! It turns out, support is much more effective here on Facebook - good job! If I need more help, I know where to go. Meantime, I feel justified to buy another language kit for one of my daughters - so Jonathan and Christy, you've not only made a customer happy but also closed a sale.####$$##%POSITIVE
still waiting on the free trial or what ever yall call it for spanish i sent off for it like 4 months ago still have yet to receive it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Don't post on my page####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please stop posting on my wall Where have you come from####$$##%NEGATIVE
Or on my wall####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just because I may have liked one picture does not mean I want to be bombarded with posts all the time and I can't seem to remove them. Please take my name off your list####$$##%NEGATIVE
I never realised someone liking you could be so permissive####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi. Yes I did in the end and it was great fun. Played buzz bingo with someone and then some simbio games with a native Spanish speaker which was hilarious! It would be really useful if the GMT times were shown on the RS website games night schedule as well as the US times as its easy to get it wrong especially when the clocks change. I've made some connections now too which will make it easier to find games partners.####$$##%POSITIVE
Theressss the problem :P####$$##%NEGATIVE
Worked, thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got the French set a few years back.  About 6 months into the set I went to France for a long visit and had the best time ever.  Rosetta Stone really prepared me for my time there.  I think Rosetta Stone is the BEST way to learn a language.  No translating, no boring grammar just a natural and easy way to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
Also, you should understand the difference between "confusion...!", as you put it, and customer expectation.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is ridiculous.  CD must be installed before using three month online portion.  Is it a big secret?!!  Must everyone with Rosetta Stone speak in riddles?  I would never have ordered this knowing that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh thanx, it works! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
2125####$$##%NEGATIVE
database is out of date and could not update####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also figured  out how to check for updates!  Thanks for your help!  I am sorry I am such an idiot!####$$##%POSITIVE
OK!  NOW it works...Sorry for over reacting!  I do need to change the setting now to check for updates... How do i do that?####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christy, my discs are at my home in costa rica. I bought them 5 years ago if that tells you anything... I have them installed on my windows vista as well as my mac. They have always upgraded occasionally before I used it. This time I got the message unable to upgrade. I am traveling now and not able to look at my discs. It was always a challenge when Igot a new computer to add it . I am over due now toget new computer. But would love to be able to use it on my i pad as well. I work for Amazon.com   Any help would be dreamy!!!!!! Gracias####$$##%NEGATIVE
No it hasn't . I would like to use my $600 program on my iPad without having to pay another fee. I feel $600 was enough.####$$##%NEGATIVE
$600 is enough!  You should offer your software on any platform for that kind of price.  Make the iPad option included and get more customers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you that link works####$$##%POSITIVE
i understand how it works I just dislike forced redirects, on any site, its just pushy!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, it was, thanks.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ouch. I almost bought it but refuse to pay $600####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with Brenda.  I purchased the software in 2008 and spent $600 and cannot use it on the ipad.  Very frustrating####$$##%NEGATIVE
I almost bought it also, but at that price forget it! They could probably charge half that and still make money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks so much....that would be great. Hope you guys offer it in the future. Have a beautiful week! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks so much... ####$$##%POSITIVE
When I went for my 1st live session -- she was speaking in sentences-questions & phrases that I DID NOT learn from unit 1 which we were to be reviewing.. I was soo lost that I logged out after 15mins.  The program (unit 1) does not teach sentences - phrases  or questions.  Plus there is no reference quide included with the $500 package for me to look up things-so there I would have to spend more $$ to buy that. There isn't even a dictionary (digital/paper) included with set.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Like I stated previously, the lessons in unit 1s instruction didn't cover sentences - questions - phrases..  I have to guess at what they are saying or asking & what my response should be. The only way I got any of the answers was because I wrote everything down from going thru the lesson twice before.####$$##%NEGATIVE
In response to your telling me to check out the article on Dynamic Immersion Method--  That was useless information since I had read that's how Rosettastone's program worked.  Thats why I purchased it.  So its useless information at this point####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is what I got back from customer service: Hello,  I think at that particular time the session's are not available, Did you tried  for some other time. If still can't see the session's according to your availability you need to get in touch with customer care department. They will help you further.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Could I get a response, please?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am using Spanish Latin America. Look at Level 2, Unit 4, Lesson 1, Grammar. "El mesero nos trae café" is incorrect. I never made a list, but there are several errors like this throughout the software. The little "pointer" to indicate that it is in first person is not consistent. There are other errors as well such as calling yenes "dollars" (or vice versa), etc.####$$##%NEGATIVE
When the whole idea is trying to recognize the patterns, and there are errors, it is very confusing and frustrating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks! We will check that out and I will work on a grant for this!####$$##%POSITIVE
Your answer doesn't make any sense. how can I learn the French grammar without being explained. Sure I learn the vocab fine, but I just want to know how will this product teach the grammar. So far it feels like its just 'trial and error' and a guessing game.####$$##%NEGATIVE
wow, strange you could connect my post with something done in private through your web site.  Im glad it worked out but Im not a fan of services hiding the cancelation procedures and making you go through an operator.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Can someone from RS please answer?  I'm posted three messages and sent two to support without receiving a response.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Am in the same boat as you, Anne. Fed up with them spamming my wall!####$$##%NEGATIVE
There are some mistakes in the content that I've emailed them about over the course of about three months, but there is been no updated to fix them.  Other than that, the idea itself and the creativity are very good; professionally directed photographs that describe content very imaginatively.  Aside of imperfections I admire RS!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
After being on chat for nearly two hours, the agent sent me an email and ended my chat session without even saying anything.  I'm furious!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Had the exact same problem. So lame.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My chat session was nearly 2 hours as well. The agent was not very nice either. The problem was not rectified.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's extremely unfortunate.  I certainly hope that Rosetta Stone doesn't condone this level of customer service.  We as customers shell out at least $400 for the product; I expect service to be on par with the amount that we've spent!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hmmmm, was considering buying one to try it out, then go on to several more if it worked for me. You guys are rapidly talking me out of it. If you can not get problems resolved you can not utilize what you spent so much hard earned money on. Looks like I will be doing without, or at least trying another less expensive program. At least it would be less wasted if I can't make use of it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Eric!  If you hadn't told me about the 'Other' bit of the messages, I wouldn't have seen your message.  As it was, I found messages people had tried to send me ranging back to nearly two years ago!####$$##%POSITIVE
It does, thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
Indeed, it is so much fun.  I am learning Hebrew and Turkish and coaches always find the way to make us (students) laugh at something the entire time which takes a lot of stress out of my day.  It is amazing!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you for your reply.####$$##%POSITIVE
Well,Rosettastone iam still not happy.I tried your 25-30mins and it just doesnt work 4me,for example i was in a 25-30mins sessions with 3other learners,some learners could not answer the questions and/or ask questions as quicky as others which turns a 25-30mins session into a 10-15mins session.In my opinion that is not enuogh time for 4students, after all in college you can get an hour long class!!! Iam not happy at all Rosetta.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow, I am not happy at all and the people on my session did not like it. It seemed just as we got started it was time to end. I am feeling like I don't want to take anymore studios. I, who took 300 before. When people that have gotten used to 50 minute studios are fazed out , the others won't know the difference. I paid for French until 2014 and have no desire to continue with the studios. It is a big disappointment to me and the aspect of Rosetta Stone that set it apart from other programs were the great studios. Now that they are gone, I would not recommend the program as I did before.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree Judy! I called Rosetta Stone today with similar feedback that you had. I'm paid up on my Italian through the end of 2013, and had I known that this change was coming, I wouldn't have paid the $150 to extend my studio sessions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed.   I had been thinking about renewing my subscription that lapsed just so I could have more studio practice. After hearing the feedback about the new format I am not so inclined to renew.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Judy,I feel the same way,i wouldnt recommend this (RS) program for just that reason.It makes you wonder, if its all about the MONEY?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rachel,i dont think 25-30mins is enough time to learn much because your in a class with 3other learners and even in a college,high school and grade school course gives you an hour per class. No RS,iam not happy at all!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks aloooooot but what about italian?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks alot I'll get it!####$$##%POSITIVE
I did that and the same thing happened.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the tip.  Practice makes perfect.####$$##%POSITIVE
Paul A. Hansen : you are going to love Rosetta Stone.  At first it may seem like some of the pics and word combinations may not make sense but stick with it and everything will fall into place.  I am just a week into Hebrew and I can already form some basic sentences and pick words out of a Hebrew newspaper.  Letters that were completely foreign to me are now beginning to be easily recognizable.  Don't try to translate, Rosetta  Stone will teach you naturally to think in your new language.  Best of luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Lesie, I think you completely misunderstand the second problem. I have everything set to the higher difficulty.  The change in typing occurred while in the same lesson. Please re-read what I wrote.    While in Spanish -LA, unit 5, lesson 3 - writing, screen 1 does the portion without proper grammar, capitalization, etc.  once you go to screen two you suddenly require grammar, punctuation, etc.  there is no continuity in the lesson.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Rachel, thank you for replying to my message.  The problem I am trying to point out is that there is really nothing on the screen or part of the exercise that points out there is supposed to be a difference.  I think what needs to be looked at is maybe you should always require proper sentences and punctuation.  I just don't get the reason for the change between the two slides or how it's supposed to help teach.  I've noticed this issue with many of the writing exercises.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Erin.   I`ve been using the RS products now for almost 2 years. In the beginning it was just for fun; for cultural reason (I started with French). Then for working reasons I moved to Mandarin and now to Arabic. The product works very well in a way that it really "sticks" in your brain (e.g: Last time I touched my Unit 1 Mandarin was last year but I still remember 90% that I`ve learned). Also, when I started the Arabic I said to myself: "impossible"...but now that I`m on the 3rd lesson I see all is possible because of the way the course is developed in a fun way that you learn faster and better than you or your kids will ever learn in any school or maybe even w. a private tutor. About the time you should invest, it depends on your "needs" and language to be learn as well (in my opinion). E.g: as a Brazilian, learning French was easier than Mandarin or Arabic because of roots and sounds (and alphabet of course). I asked this same question to RS team; they suggested no more than 2 hours a day. But sometimes I`m having so much fun and my mind is rested that I easily took 4 or more hours straight!!! But it really depends on how much time you`ll have (I would recommend 1 hour or a goal of 1 lesson per day w/ a review next day if not achived 100% on every section). For kids; I would say 2 differents moments a day of 30 minutes each. The RS has many games; you and your family will have fun while you learn! Good luck:) I hope I could help.####$$##%POSITIVE
My husband is currently learning Russian with RS. He loves it, learns very easily he said. And hes busy, with work and life. Time is taken when he can, but about 1 hour a week is what it works out to be. Its slow but its working. Good luck!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'd try a different program. There is no instruction included on the language in your language, you often have to guess at the meanings. Rosetta Stone is not a good way to learn another language in my opinion.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I speak French fluently because of Rosetta Stone and now am learning Hebrew.  Lessons are broken up into different amounts of times, some are 30 minutes and others are 5 minutes.  I usually spend about an hour at a time and will often do 3,  1 hours sessions in a day.  Rosetta Stone is an amazing way to learn.  Just trust the system and you will find in just a few lessons that your new language will start to take hold.  In one week I am already able to form simple sentences in Hebrew without any translation.  Best of Luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
Justin, the new format is nice but takes some getting used to.  I'll look at the link.  Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
i dont think the half hour sessions are enough time to learn much in classroom setting with four students,after all even college,high school,and grade school gives you an hour.Its going to be hard to progress under this NEW classroom setting. P.S Love RS but dont like the new time limit####$$##%NEGATIVE
That would be great!!! I appreciate it so much. I need to learn and can't find good Danish material anywhere!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the response Lesie. I already do use the activities in Rosetta World, but have always found the Studio sessions more helpful. My biggest gripe is that as time has progressed since I bought my 1st Rosetta Stone language, the amount of Studio time we can schedule continues to shrink. When I first started (roughly 2 years ago), I believe we were able to schedule 5 50-minute Studio sessions, and now we're down to 2 25-minute sessions, which is an 80% reduction. I wish I had known this change was coming a few months ago when I decided to continue my Studio access for $150. I might not have made that choice, knowing what I know now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was great. When your able to share there language it help you bond with the people your trying to help. I wish I had the money to buy it for my self and my son. It would be nice to se him to speak author language####$$##%POSITIVE
I still am. Especially the online studio sessions.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Also to hang around for example on a weekend isn't worth it for 25 minutes. The number you take should be increased. You used to get 100 minutes for the 2 sessions you signed up for and now you only get 50 minutes. To get advanced levels sometimes you have to sign up a couple of weeks in advance at least in Port. and then you can't take any classes in the meantime.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't either. You really don't have time to cover the core lesson. You get little time to speak and the shortened class is not an advantage except for RS who saves money by having the coaches teach twice as many students in 50 minutes as before. Some of the coaches end in 20 minutes because they might have to go to the restroom between sessions or because 5 minutes is iffy to get back on. Many times there are tech problems are they need the 10 minutes to make sure they are there on time. RS tries to tell us it is for our benefit but really it is to save them money in my opinion.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am not certain as to which languages they offer.  check out their web site. I would say this based on my experience with them. If they have the language in which you are interested, then get the software. This resent version has taken the program up a HUGE notch.   I have been learning Italian and I went there this past summer. Because of my Rosetta Stone lessons I was able to communicate with people. Not just when I was carrying out transactions such as buying something in a store or getting from one place to another. I was able to talk with people that I met. A major part of travel for me is getting to know the local people, to visit with them and speak with them about the way they live. My wife and I rode bikes through Italy. There multiple times when I would stop in a town square and just talk with the people. It was very rewarding.   So I would really encourage you to use this software.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the quick response, Hunter!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much for your offer that's very kind of you. My point was not really for myself as more for young people interested in languages that even of a payment plan would be a hardship in today's economy. Again thank you for your response. Sincerely Jose Soto####$$##%POSITIVE
It wasnt the headset guy...the program stopped recognizing any mic input, all other programs work fine even with the Rosetta Stone mic/headset.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I understand that it works for you and for a lot of other people.  I'm just saying that when it doesn't work, they won't help you.  Actually we are still in contact with them about this.  If they fix it, I will remove my post.####$$##%NEGATIVE
really rosetta, i would love that####$$##%POSITIVE

I dont agree Elaine,I think that rosettastone should offer both hour and half hour sessions,because iam spending most of my time trying to get in sessions and the sessions are to short to learn anything that willl help me to advance to the next level,other words at times its not very challenging. Think about it rosettastone!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I was wondering if we got the online access, if my kids could access different languages with one subscription. And by the way Rosetta, your online demos are not working.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Nice one Laurie...  This is getting agrovating...  I have never seen thair sucess team take THIS LONG to answer a question...  >.<####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am REALLY thrilled, and it's THE best way to learn another language. Well, I will go with the 3 levels. Have just ended Level 1 - it has taken quite a while, as it is soooo thorough - so I just started Level  2 :-D I think it's great that it's local voices - and with different accents - I for sure am a HUGE fan :-D - THANKS for forward my request about Danish. Have a great day :-D and THANKS!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! If you need anyone that knows the language and teaches it already, I can refer you to them, if  the Rosetta team is really interested.####$$##%POSITIVE
sorry this doesn't help. I am using the cd rom verson that is installed on my computer.  Once the online services expired, there seems to no longer be any ability to access the web through it.  If I try to sign on the online sign in page, then it tests my computer and says my flash version is too old and won't do anything else. Can I call a number? thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Cynthia, I'm using the same product and am on Level 1 Unit 3. I use the Totale Companion app on my phone and I try to listen and repeat what is said without reading the screen. That helps me out quite a bit.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sorry to point this out but you are incorrect. I have the latest Samsung Galaxy S III and your support could not get it to work. They said it should for about 3 hours.

Note that Android devices do not support flash so your totale companion is required.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Portuguese (Brazil), level 1, lesson 4, general... no error message, it starts to load the next screen and it freezes, that's it... every time the same thing... do you have an email??####$$##%NEGATIVE
The price I saw was $500 and even at half that I can not afford it. I am sure it is a good program, but I am on a fixed income and even with a student discount it was out of my reach. I am an older student and even though I am not 'officially' retired I am not far from it. Disability prevents me from working and I was hoping to pick this up, but it will likely not come to fruition. I had to make some financial arrangements when my last computer crashed. I purchased then computer I am on and bought everything I wanted, including programs, except the Rosetta Stone. Maybe in a few years I can afford it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
But - it does seem like it's worse for learners now since before it was that you could set 2 sessions of 50 minutes each and now it is 20 minutes each. So I don't see the improvement and I'm quite upset about it...####$$##%NEGATIVE
If you want to communicate clearly and concisely, answer the question.  Is it that you can only schedule 2 at a time with no limit on the number of sessions per month or is it that you are now limited to a maximum total of 2 sessions per month?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wish I could afford Rosetta Stone.  It's never available at my local library. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rachel, it was an ordeal. It would have been almost impossible to do via chat. I am very grateful to Ed.####$$##%POSITIVE
Feedback about the games - I love the games, I think it's a great way to learn vocubulary but I have a few issues, with the Japanse at least. Picari and Memgo - I keep getting words and phrases from the first units and not from what I need to memorise - I'm in unit 4 and not getting the vocubulary for units 3 and 4. so it becomes boring unfortunatelly. Buzzbingo - all the words are in Kanji and I just can't always read - I managed to learn some of them, and they are too small to undestand the drawing. I wish I could at least see it clearly... so it's a game####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well Thank You Rachel so very much!!! :) :p####$$##%POSITIVE
Two a week seems reasonable.  Two a month is ridiculous,  especially since the new sessions (after October 15) are only 25 minutes  each.  In a message dated 10/27/12 2:27:08 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time,####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just ran into a problem where my second session of the month had technical difficulties (voice communication was intermittant) and by the time we got everything sorted out 15 mintues had gone by.  I finished the last 10 minutes (sharing time with the other student - only one this session) and found it counts as a full session and now I have no more this month.  I have a 'case' in with RS to see if they will reissue that session..... but no response yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My learning path is two units a month, so I am two sessions short####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like the ideas of making the schedules more flexible, but y'all can't cut the two hours long studio time  into an hour a month with the same price. That discourages learner a lot.####$$##%NEGATIVE
There weren't even options to purchase how many sessions I can have, and it didn't mention the changes at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As a follow up......I completed all the "reviews" & the program is now completed.  I did a "live chat" with Rosetta Stone & was informed that I cannot see a final grade.  Unbelievable!!!!  After ll of that, one cannot see a final score.  I will NOT be buying level 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
That doesn't seem fair!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Victor.....first I should Thank you for your response.  FYI......my case # 01600728, if that is of any help to you.####$$##%POSITIVE
Doesn't seem right not to receive a final grade after all of those lessons ( 140 or so).  It scores each one individually, but does not give you a final tally at the end of the course?  Extremely frustrating & disappointing!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
I would like to learn Arabic, but I wont be doing any installments anytime soon. I heard from people that ur program us good, but overpriced. Then I saw so with my own eyes. Thanks anyway.####$$##%NEGATIVE

thank you very much.. i rather learn then wait.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for clarifying!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you. I tried that and no luck. The microphone was working before. I used the program back in February and it worked just fine, no problems. On Monday, I decided I needed to get back on the program and I opened up the program and there was an update for Rosetta Stone. I updated the program (I really don't know what the problem is at this point) and started back on the units. I remembered about the graph pronunciation and wanted to use it again. That is what is holding me up and I want to have it working again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Success!!! I got on the Live Chat and I have to say, the person who helped me should received a metal!####$$##%POSITIVE

Brandi, I also volunteer as an ESL teacher at a local literacy organization. They use Rosetta Stone English in their computer labs and the students love it. It seems to be a great start for the beginners especially, as they're sometimes reluctant to come to classes without some basic knowledge. Best of luck to you and your students. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank-you very much for your prompt response, I appreciate the offer and will most likely call. One more question...is there anyway you would be able to provide me with the/a code as I'd like to go to skymileshopping.com then to rosetta stone as I would be able to earn Delta Airlines SkyMiles as well? Thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank YOU!####$$##%POSITIVE
Moving from unlimited to limited is not am improvement.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for those links Christy and I did the setup like they said but now the mic no longer functions at all.You have to count to 5 and it says Im not saying anything which I am so I give up on the voice recognition part.I was sure that would help me learn spanish but its just not happening with rosetta stone.As for rosetta stone I must say its the hardest thing Ive ever studied in my life including all school and college.Its easy to understand why ,it gives me a word like COME...CO MAY which means eat in spanish and after a while of looking at people eatting(the photos) and passing the test rosetta stone gives me a sentance fragment using COME in it...but rosetta never tells me what the new words are at all.Ive never seen them or heard them in my life but somehow Im supposed to know what they are because Ive been given the word come.So I pay almost 400 dollars for totale and I sit looking up words in an english/spanish dictionary but never really know  where or when to use  them because spanish is backwards from engish,the subject comes first.Confusion is the understatement when I think about trying to learn this using rosetta stone and I sure wish it had worked because I really need to learn spanish for my business.OH well,maybe someday Ill figure out what to do but rosetta stone isnt for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The voice recognition has never worked for me either. My daughter's best friends are from Colombia too, n it says they aren't speaking Spanish either####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Georgia,I thought I was dumb there or something but zulays sister is here with me right now and she doesnt speak english AT ALL and rosetta stone says shes not saying words right.Christy from rosetta sent those links and I followed the instructions perfectly but now the mic doesnt work which it did before and its not christys fault ...its just terrible software because this laptop is new and using rosetta stones suggestions it still doesnt work and now works worse...LOL...Georgia,I pass 99% of the test easily because Im picking up the one and only word the system teaches me,its all the words that mean are and have and has and such that I dont know what they are ....rosetta doesnt teach that,it gives them to you as Im sure you know but it never tells you what they are .I guess they think if you seem them enough you'll just know when to use them...kinda hard when you have no idea what they mean....so it says nada which means swim and you see people swimming,you click it and you passed the test YAAAAY...but the other 5 words in the sentance you are clueless about and it never tells you what they are...at least through section 1 it doesnt.I give up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well,Zulay speaks spanish FIRST before english but mostly all I hear is her half of a cell phone call.I hear lots of words spoken very quickly in a language that I dont speak.She watches spanish tv lots and it means NOTHING to me.Me hearing it spoken doesnt seem to teach it to me.Ive been with her for 7 years and Ive learned NOTHING from her at all.Ive sat and watch her spanish soaps for 30 minutes and tried to understand but it just sounds like a language I dont speak and nothing else.It could be greek,or german or japanese,it doesnt matter,me hearing it doesnt teach it to me which is why I hoped rosetta might work.Im picking up single words but for me to learn a word it has to point blank tell me what that word is in english but rosetta doesnt do that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well Rosettastone,I would not recommend this program to anyone who respects the value of a dollar$$$. You see Rosettastone iam not a person with money to burn and to pay someone 25dollar or more(for private sessions) an hour on sessions is not something i can do. I do believe that this is another way of getting your money no matter how you try to explain it away.####$$##%NEGATIVE
When you (RS) stated that the sessions were going to be shorter and that you could access them sooner, I thought that was great.  Now, I hear that you can only do two per month, and I wonder what you were thinking.  You should have mentioned this when you announced that the sessions were getting shorter.  You need two per unit now, so that is 4 months just to do the basics. A lot of people could get through the program in the 3-month time frame, but now they would need 20 months(for a five-level program) and have to limit their progress.  Not a good for customer retention ploy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
And there doesn't seem to be that many more available either! Couple that with the limit to only 2 a month and what you get is a complete joke! When my online subscription expires I will not be renewing it. It's a great course but you've made the access to studio sessions even worse! Janice is right, surely your customer retention will go down!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I know that I will not renew the online portion, and I know of others that wanted to study another language or renew, but have decided to go with another program.  Your customer service has always been sketchy, but the canned responses that you give to complaints is not only annoying, but disrespectful.  Even the positive aspect of your product is overshadowed by the constant change of procedure.  I am not a fan anymore, and could never recommend your product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, not everyone wants to just play games.  Most people want to SPEAK the language, and the practice with a native speaker trained to guide you gives confidence in a way that games or chatting with random people does not give.  This is especially true when you have certain goals.  Shame on you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't think that learners are pleased. Most of us, who were under the old system, are not pleased. You really should have let those of us who were using the program that there would be a new policy before you instituted it.  That is not good customer service.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would rather them be online, but why even send out cd's would it not be more cost effective to email access codes to customers who would want online only access?   And when attempting to type in my authorization code I hade to actually Draft in a word processing application and copy and paste into the dialog box. I do not feel I got $500 worth of product####$$##%NEGATIVE
yes it is true####$$##%NEGATIVE
So, long story short is that there are no longer unlimited Studio sessions. This will definitely affect my decision to reactivate my older RS subscriptions. I don't see how RS plans on staying in business by offering less and less for the same price.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They (RS) just added an extra studio session por month so its 3 studio sessions now but its still not enough,(RS) i dont think you care about the success of your customers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah...definitely not enough Studio time to get really proficient. Looks like Pimsleur will be getting my business from now on!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You're right! I'm a Mitt Romney fan, AND I'm learning Chinese. I am excited about being able to communicate with people whose language and ancient culture I find fascinating. Rosetta Stone is a great way to do this.####$$##%POSITIVE
Just wondering if there is a problem with my message indicator as I have not received an email from anyone at RS yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE

yes it is very expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Compared to the amount you would pay for tutors and books, rearranging your schedule to attend classes, gas to drive to school, etc., this program is very reasonably priced. I've studied 7 languages (in a formal setting) since 1986, and this program is by far the most interactive and conducive to learning. I didn't buy the program expecting to become a convert; I'm an old-school rote learner and expected to not like it. But I'm totally sold.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have just left a message on your site advising that last week you asked me to re load my language discs as I had error 3217 - they will not re load only have the option to 'view' the files - frustrating! Please help me as I want to start this course tonight x####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi there no pm from you :)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I upgraded my Rosetta stone and now it won't work. I've called every number but can't reach an actual person. The program opens gives me a different error # each time then crashes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!! It's very useful. I've the first french level and is amazing how I can learn so fast... In Spain, the problem with languaje students are the speaking and listening.

But the online coaching sessions are going to cost a pretty penny ,Andre. Think about it first, you only get 3 thirty min. sessions per month for $25 and private sessions cost $40 for one session. If I were you I would think about it ,unless you have money to burn.####$$##%NEGATIVE

the "connections" I had and talked to that liked the shorter sessions still had NO idea though that you were only going to allow 2 a month. That's a total lie to call it "more offten" when it's only twice a month. How on earth is that "more often"? you're still not addressing this. no one knows the subscriptions are changing. That's NEVER been addressed. So of course people seem happy so far.. cuz they're clueless. You're lying to your costumers, and frankly, I strongly feel that this practice of yours is illegal, and a "bait and switch". As I said, I'm continuing only because I feel I have no choice at this point, but I'm Extremely upset...####$$##%NEGATIVE

Aaron, i'm having the same issues.  I just got a copy of Tuttle "learning Chinese characters" HSK Level A, and Pimsleur, level 1, and it's a ton easier.  I never did figure out what's going on on the Rosetta Stone, especially the character recognition...you really need the history behind how a character is formed in order to learn to recognize it.  Stroke order is also important, and rosetta stone doesn't teach you that either.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your information says "Users  whose subscriptions activation date is before October 14,2012 will have access to unlimited sessions per month." My activation dates back a year and iam still limited to 2 sessions whats up with that?####$$##%NEGATIVE

I would like to but being unemployed I can not even afford a payment plan at this time. As a single mother it is not a priority even though it would make me more employable in my area being bilingual. But I will sign up for the promotions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Actually I tend not to publish negative comments about well known companies but the person I spent 45 minutes chatting with kept repeating the same questions over and over again.  My whole experience was so frustrating that I save all of the transcripts because it was almost unbelievable.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's an amazing system, and it's fun i was on my computer for like 3 hours learning!####$$##%POSITIVE
The issue is mainly my wife's.  After spending nearly $3k on RS products (5 languages), she can't get any of them working properly and has been back and forth several times with the so-called customer service with no help in sight.  I also tried to install one of the languages (nothing shady, her license allows it) and after some initial trouble it worked briefly, but is not working on my machine either now.  The whole experience has soured us both.####$$##%NEGATIVE
A phone number to a real person who understands English well enough to help me and who is willing to help me instead of simply responding with canned responses for links on the help website that are not resolving my issues would be amazing. When the program is working well, it is very good. I would love to use it. I had intended for these 5 to be a starter for me, as there are several languages beyond these I am interested in learning. The problem is when it generates multiple errors as I have been experiencing, it seems like no one is interested in helping me resolve the issues. It is just extremely upsetting to spend so much money and have so many problems. This is part of my education & I need these programs to work. Additionally, because the license covers two installs and my husband is interested in learning Spanish, I feel resolving that issue is important too.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you.  It would be nice if there were more examples, as it takes a beginner a long time to figure out which two characters should be combined to create certain half-forms.  I have been lucky enough to have some help in areas where I have been stuck.  However, others may not be so lucky.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you.  I seem to have this problem taken care of, however, I've tried to install the language disk numerous times and at the very end it gives me error 9118 and says "there was an error in the application."  The only option is to exit the application.####$$##%NEGATIVE
When you buy all levels all at once with the three months included for online access, all you get is three months total, not three months for each level..####$$##%NEGATIVE
That would be cool! Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
If that's true, that's ridiculous####$$##%NEGATIVE
But you want to start right away when you finish lesson 2, so you're not going to wait six months. So by the time you get to level 2 and 3 you have to pay more money to get more studio sessions. That's ridiculous.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks. I know that someday soon i can maybe afford to buy your program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! I'll check it out. Maybe I'll ask Santa to bring it to me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi there! I did not receive any private message in my inbox.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Great, thanks!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Of course =D & Thank You for your response & feedback R.S.####$$##%POSITIVE
Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Money comes to us working class people hard and if she's is hard selling us trying to take it away that whole relationship is a lose lose for the consumer. If that makes any sense. She was comitting a sales rape. She was attempting to force the product on me therefore I researched my community college and it is actually cheaper for a semester of Spanish than it is to purchase part 1 of your program. Thank you sirs but no thank you and the 7 friends who like you I forwarded my poor customer care experience to them and to my other 398 friends on 2 accounts. Continued success in all your endeavors. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok thanks (:####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rosemary, Thank you for the support! I need to get on my way for now, but I'm looking forward to get your mail and to be able to continue the learnings! :) Thanks again, have a great night!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for the info.  I have submitted a request on the link you provided.  Also, I'd like to note that Thai is still an option on that page you sent me where you hit "Select a language" --- might want to update and remove that.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes thats awesome####$$##%POSITIVE
I see that Rosetta Stone does not teach you to capitalize all nouns in German.####$$##%NEGATIVE
if anything it should be 2 sessions per week####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your quick response. I am satisfied with the lessons being split into 2 30 minute sessions. I do utilize Rosetta world on a daily basis. Like I said before, i love Rosetta stone so please, do not give us a limit as to how many times we can use studio.####$$##%POSITIVE
I got the same email!! I filled out the survey and never heard anything else.  I would like to know what happened with that as well!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Rain all sorted. I got an email saying they have extended it!.... Janice Kennedy did you?####$$##%POSITIVE
I was using Windows XP and it was not working. Then I reimage my laptop with Windows 7 and it's still not working. The program will only open gray background with never ending progress bar. No error message and no activation menu as program stuck in this screen. Troubleshooting done: Restart computer, Reinstall and Install, Update Adobe Air and Adobe Flash, Update TOTALe program to 4.5, launch the program as ADMIN, configure Internet connection setting, reimage laptop with Windows 7####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just clicked on the blue icon again and it still prompted me for an update. sigh.####$$##%NEGATIVE
YAY thank you thank you####$$##%POSITIVE
great customer service on FB... appreciated!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank You Simy. Same to you and your family. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Couldn't agree with you more James. Your website is confusing (deliberately I assume) - 4 CD-ROM sets, TOTALe online with 12 mos. access, Rosetta Course for iPad. For the life of me I can't figure out the total cost and which applications I need to purchase.  From your site: "Learn Spanish (Spain) w/ TOTALe online, 12 mo. access, $239." What does that include?  Can I use the Rosetta Course for iPad?  Why would I purchase the CD-ROM set for $400 or so if I can just purchase 12 mo. access for much less? How much does online access cost after the 12 mos.? I sent e-mails to customer support specifically requesting a total price but never rec'd a reply.  No support before a sale?  Seems like your customer service rap is deserved.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Lesie for the quick response. I sent you a reply but with the reduction in studio class time to 50 minutes a month it's difficult for me to consider RS as a serious language learning program.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That sounds like a good deal. But i cant buy it right now####$$##%POSITIVE
But they do offer both Latin American Spanish and the Spanish spoken in Spain... They couldn't offer a different package for every Spanish speaking country. Also, they do offer a money back policy if you buy from them as long as you return it within 6 months. Also, you may not like the program but many do and it works for them so you can't really say it doesn't work. Also immersing yourself into the culture is what RS is trying to achieve without a person having to move to a country where they speak the language. This wouldnt be very convenient or affordable for many people now would it?.... So in conclusion YOU'RE THE IGNORANT ONE!####$$##%POSITIVE
Liam I completely agree with you, I find the way RS works really effective & it works for me.  I think maybe it just doesn't work for small minded people who don't have the attention span or intelligence to sit & learn.  Good luck with your RS journey :) ####$$##%POSITIVE
Don't apologise for being able to go and travel to such wonderful places... Ur very lucky indeed! For all the people who DON'T have the money or time to do this its a brilliant way to learn. Isn't sitting in front of a screen/teacher the way a majority of people learn? You need all the buena suerte you can get! #narrowminded####$$##%POSITIVE
This isn't twitter, Adelle. In the end I think it's cool that people are learning other languages besides english. Bottom Line- I personally just don't think RS is worth it. I mean for that price, just go to the country. I'm only 21 and i've been all of those places already but I didn't learn spanish by sitting in front of a screen, I learned by practicing daily. I do apologize for making you people think this is a personal attack against you or something but I suppose you needed to stand up for what you believe in and I respect that. After all, a mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if it isn't open, right? What kind of culture comes with each language? is it up to date? I don't own a RS but I have a few friends who do but they don't have great things to say about it. Let me know####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks so much for getting back so quick , and please do also let me know how many requests are needed to get the program out I know tons of people who would love it####$$##%POSITIVE
You should use it again if you have the time, seeing as you have already paid for it.... Even if you don't have the online access just do the course parts and see if you like it again. You never know, you might get right back into it. You've got nothing to lose! Happy learning and good luck.####$$##%POSITIVE
Got my offer in my inbox already ...YEAH :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
GOOD.####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't mean for this to post to my Facebook page...I use this at school and it is a great program, but definitely way too expensive. I am not their marketing person...I received an email and now this!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool wow####$$##%POSITIVE
You have totally missed the point of my email. In response to the comment you have made, oddly enough 1 50 minute tutorial can cover just as much ground as 2 25 minute tutorials - in fact even more ground as only 1 lot of time is spent welcoming people, saying goodbye and dealing with internet problems as opposed to having to do it all twice per 50 minutes. However, that was not my point at all. My point was that 2 25 minute sessions PER MONTH is a ridiculously short and expensive length of time. I can do the same with private tutorials where I will get 1 on 1 tuition rather than having to share my time with others. Unitl now the number of tutorials per month has been unlimited and now we are suddenly dropped to a putrid 2  - even with NO notification of this change - you simply let us find out the hard way when sessions could no longer be booked having fulfilled our allowance. We are now absolutely disgusted with Rosetta Stone and instead of recommending it to our friends and acquaintances here in Spain as we have been doing we are now going to actively warn people about how expensive it is and what a waste of money. Disgusting behaviour on behalf or Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was kind of them to let you know that 2 half sessions are actually much better than unlimited full sessions.  I'm sure you're fully satisfied now!!   ;)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Looking at the RS website, it's impossible to figure out the true cost and what you are getting for your money. I've given up and will go with Web Spanish for my Spanish learning needs.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you hope you guys are able to get it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Whoa that's high; No I have never purchased any of your products ever####$$##%POSITIVE
Ta :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Whenever I launch Rosetta Studio/ Rosetta World, it prompts me to buy an online subscription. I don't think I should have to pay for something that was originally included in the disk. Taking away the online coach literally forces you to get an online subscription.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hey RS, how about putting a link to information like this on your website? It's sorely lacking in detail.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am learning spanish right now too... It DOES work. It is very clever. I love this program, I could take spanish tests all day! :D####$$##%POSITIVE
Christy, it still not work. I renamed it to Rosetta Stone2 and launch the program but it still freeze####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've wanted to buy your products for quite sometime, but 1 I'm not sure it works! 2 I can't usually afford it! I started to learn Hebrew before. But, I'm sure it's Modern Hebrew instead of biblical! How close are they?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like your add.####$$##%POSITIVE

Me gusta gratis####$$##%POSITIVE
unless it drops to the same price of the pimsleur approach, it cant possibly be the 'best deal ever'####$$##%NEGATIVE
In other words: Rosetta Stone is usually ridiculously expensive, now it's only expensive! lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
don't care i live in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA I SPEAK ENGLISH...THEY HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER !!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
why are you so expensive?????####$$##%NEGATIVE
get off my news feed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
How do you say "spam" in French?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have to admit that this picture makes me want to go shopping. It hit my spend button.####$$##%POSITIVE
It better not be their normal sale price, which is usually always on sale. Make it $100 cheaper than the normal sale price and I'll consider it, but not a dollar more.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Get your pagan garbage off my fb!! I don't want your ads!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I want to learn Thai but you don't offer it anymore.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Screw you facebook and your corporate garbage! You are turning into myspace.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You have to have a big sale to afford Rosetta Stone!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I used to like Rosetta Stone.  Now they have spammed my News Feed and the sight of their name makes me feel ill.  They paid money to annoy me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
He tomado cursos en el Community College.  Lo que es mejor con RS es la oportunidad de hablar el idioma.  No tuve oportunidades en el Community College. AHora, con el cambio de sus "studio sessions", esta ventaja no existe.  Que lastima. . . .####$$##%NEGATIVE
demasiado expensive...####$$##%NEGATIVE
a eso me refiero....mucho money..! He visto comerciales en TV de personas hablando ingles "aprendido de RS" , y esta muy mal pronunciado...! ####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, es barato ahora. Si puede, necesito comprarlo pronto porque hay una oferta y es sólo $399!####$$##%POSITIVE
Mmmmm????? This page is cazy....####$$##%NEGATIVE
cool####$$##%POSITIVE
Please remove yourself from my fb. If I want to learn another language I would go back to school. Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
very nice####$$##%POSITIVE
Does it still cost $1000 to learn another language?####$$##%NEGATIVE
i wish i could afford it even at the sale rates...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ann you must be shopping ? Ann's private heaven!  Get some good deals!  heheheh####$$##%POSITIVE
I like Rosetta Stone too!####$$##%POSITIVE
This offer could be a rip off.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think Rosetta Stone is cool but expensive-right?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I guess its a good program, Its most likely my memory thats not good.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks  for reminding me,Greg!! "I'd like to learn how to speak German/Spanish and Chinese."  I see you're enjoying this so much :)####$$##%POSITIVE
It doesn't work.####$$##%NEGATIVE
using their arabic course now - it's pretty good - i have another book to learn the jordanian spoken dialect but therosetta stone gets you going####$$##%POSITIVE
Get off my fb!!  I do 't want your ads!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Gee Martha. I've got Rosetta in 2 different languages, and I never got a deal. Really helped brushing up on French before my trip last May. Now I need to plan a trip to a Spanish speaking destination to provide more motivation. It is good to know living here as well though; not too many French speakers around.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cooooool.####$$##%POSITIVE
Great for practice for bending verbal communication turning a sentence by bending/syncing opening the secrets of language, sounds and harmony revealing factor of a global all-in-one system####$$##%POSITIVE
go away and stop advertising, I didnt even "like" you page and I get this junk.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great Product!. Got the free trial package and liked it a lot... if someone is going to have a serious need for learning another language, this is the way to go!  Are you using this now??####$$##%POSITIVE
wow finally something not 1d####$$##%POSITIVE
Interesting...####$$##%POSITIVE
Used this while we were homeschooling....loved it!####$$##%POSITIVE
There is no Serbian instruction available, last time I checked.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Bring back the Ukraine. You only had it for a short while, RUSSIAN is NOT THE SAME!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sounds worth looking into!####$$##%POSITIVE
Uninvited advertising sucks!  I wish they would keep this crap off my Facebook!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome! Thank you RS i will look into it.####$$##%POSITIVE
There are some good ASL programs already on the market that cost a lot less then Rosetta Stone ever does! You don't really need any software for ASL since you just watch the hand symbols and movements. I learned for free from some Youtube videos!####$$##%NEGATIVE
what a steal####$$##%NEGATIVE
En serio Roca Rosetta es muy ridiculo! Ellos no puede ensenanos que es la diferencia en los tenses futuro y condicional!####$$##%NEGATIVE
guess it's a real sale? still too much..####$$##%NEGATIVE
saved like 50$ free 2 day shipping is nice tho :)####$$##%POSITIVE
That's expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I spent $399 for a 5 level language in May of 2011. This is a $25 discount. The regular price is $499-for about a year! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Cheaper than that at Barnes & Noble today!####$$##%POSITIVE
The app doesn't work. Check the ratings & reviews on Google Play if you plan on using it. It's only rated 2 starss. A lot of frustrated subscribers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would consider if the price were between $75-100.  Just being honest.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think still a little bit high on that price..... I'm just saying.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Opt Out is NOT an option, according to the links you provide.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Your salespeople always say "Well we have Russian"####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great deal sounds lovely to me! New parents over here & it would be nice to teach our son & his father another language at the same time :?####$$##%POSITIVE
It is steep, so come on "Big Savings"!  And, yes Please fo a give-away sometime ...it would be so nice!  ####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone, have you learned that you cannot treat every language the same way? One cannot learn Spanish in the same way they learn Japanese. You have to cater your product to suit the language. All languages cannot be taught the same way. I would love to get Japanese levels 1-5 but the price is ridiculous. I will stick with Human Japanese. Better value and they recognize you cannot teach Japanese the same way you can teach all other languages. :P####$$##%NEGATIVE
Think it sucks as I have paid thru the a$$ for this product. I like my classes but at my age I am having difficulty learning. Never 2 late will keep working at it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i wanna learn a different language...if the price is right im in####$$##%POSITIVE
Free sounds good...because your product is out of my ball park!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I did join and didn't get the link to the best deal ever.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like that... 5 part payment plan sounds good... We need to follow a credit check or how we apply for that?####$$##%POSITIVE
Listen.Rosetta stone works.I bought Spanish on Xmas last year and now I speak fluently a year later.go threw the levels twice to make sure you have it####$$##%POSITIVE
Wish there was a special on #4 and #5.  I already have  #1 - #3 (Latin American Spanish).####$$##%NEGATIVE
Victor, now that's more like it! Just sucks that I tried two different official channels and couldn't get any help that way. I'm on a Mac, specifically a MacBook Air without a CD drive. I really appreciate your assistance. Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Found it......disappointed Farsi has not been added to the list!!!:(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nice!####$$##%POSITIVE
looks awesome!####$$##%POSITIVE
i am with u on the peace & quiet ordeal.  it's nothing like it.(lol)####$$##%POSITIVE
Would love to take advantage of this offer, but WOW!! Never thought learning another language could cost so much. That's a car payment! ;/####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh! Perfect, so my MacBook Pro would be the logical choice then. Thank you!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I didn't like Rosetta Stone.  Other people did like it, but I need someone to explain things to me.   What language are you trying to learn?  For French/Spanish/Italian/Mandarin, you may want to test out www.fluenz.com.  We have that for Spanish, and we are SERIOUSLY considering Destinos for Spanish, which are DVDs with text book, workbooks, CDs, and other items.  (Destinos is only for Spanish.)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Guys!!!! :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks so much. I'll give it a try and advise of any issues. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you! I'd like for my husband to learn it and communicate with my family easier lol####$$##%POSITIVE
So why does it post 3 to 5 times per day.  I once thought about buying the product, but now I hate the company and would NEVER buy R S product!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have had this problem for ages with Spanish.  Don't seem to be able to do nything about iy though.a####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ordered my Espanol today. Can't wait to learn a new language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ordered my Russian. Thanks Rosetta Stone####$$##%POSITIVE
You're going to love Spanish, Holly! I ordered French a couple of days ago...Can't wait to get started on my third language!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your message. I probably won't at this time, the payment plan would have made a difference in my decision. Hopefully this will become available in the future, I will probably buy the package then. Thanks again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Is it two sessions per unit, or two sessions per month? My subscribers area says two per month. I'm less annoyed if it's two per unit, although that still sucks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is 2 per month.  You are right - it is useless and doesn't help with speaking.  Even though you may be able to "practice" with a native speaker faster, it is definitely NOT an improvement.  They have lost and will lose a lot more clients unless they find a more reasonable alternative.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I highly recommend Rosetta Stone for the language enthusiasts.  I have Italian, Japanese, & Portuguese.   Also check on amazon  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0615557899/ref=mp_s_a_1?qid=1353200132&sr=8-1&pi=SL75####$$##%POSITIVE
You don't have Serbian. :(  My boyfriend is very sad####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed! Just bought the complete Latin American Spanish (1-5) set. That free shipping didn't hurt either. <3####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh, and was interested, not now.  Customer lost.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ha ha, auto post, nice customer service.  Buying someone else's product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I'm learning some stuff but when i talk to my Korean friends they say its wrong####$$##%NEGATIVE
one CAN'T opt out of FB ads (per the link you provided).####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've done that - long ago. What I can't do is prevent advertisements, like yours, from hitting on my main feed, populating my page with all kinds of crap I'm not interested in, and getting in the way of the posts I do wish to see from friends, family, colleagues and clients.  Can only hope FB will wake up soon, and put these kinds of advertisements with all others, in the right column, where they belong. If our pages start being overrun with ads (and it's slowly happening), FB is going to lose a lot of members to other forums, and those companies putting up those ads are going to effectively piss people off, such that they will lose their potential business, rather than gain it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Useless links,  was going to buy,  now not.  This is the kind of thing that makes people go to the competition####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's best to actually read and consider someone's post, rather than just respond with auto-responses, or to repeat useless info that DOES NOT APPLY to the post. So, again, I understand about the privacy settings with regard to the brands I've LIKED.  Again -  I HAVE NOT LIKED YOUR PAGE. These are paid/promoted advertisements in my regular feed, that are beginning to clog our feed and keep us from seeing posts from friends, family - and colleagues and clients for many of u!.  For the 3rd time - WE CAN NOT OPT OUT OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My privacy settings are all set appropriately, but they do not address THIS ISSUE.  Your electing to do this will backfire on you in the long run.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still too damn expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
too rich for my blood. I will learn it the old fashion way. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wish I could buy that for my daughter. That's wonderful price.####$$##%POSITIVE
I bought Levels 1-5 of German woooooo! Thanks for the great deal!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have a question, how can you say this is $400 less when Amazon usually sells discs 1-5 for the same exact price?  They have it now and usually do as I have looked at it before and haven't bought it at that price because I can't afford to pay that much.  The only advantage I see is the payment plan but you are still paying the same in the end.  You and I both know that the price will not go to $700+ after the special is over.  So could you please explain why you guys think this is such a good price when it is available at that price already?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Monica, I took advantage of their sale for homeschool Spanish software today. With that particular software, I couldn't get it quite as cheap on Amazon, but almost. However, the 6 month guarantee is only good if you buy from the RS site directly. That's a big deal to me. I've read great stuff about RS but it doesn't work for everyone, and if it doesn't "click" for my kids, I want to be able to get my  money back.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks, I submitted a new language request. I'm only interested in learning Hungarian as I'm marrying into a Hungarian family. Do you have a list of languages that you are coming out with in the future or currently working on? There are a few other proudcts that teach Hungarian but nothing to the quality of Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
according to those links, we CAN'T opt out.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yep.  And companies pay to put them in your newsfeed.  I know this cause I have a friend with a company page.  It's not an accident they are showing up there.  I shouldn't have to delete them per post.  If I don't like a page, it has no business showing up in my newsfeed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So, if companies have enough money to harass me in my newsfeed, then they don't need any of mine.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks a lot, wanted to get it for ages while you had it but parents never let me.... :(####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Christy. Seems to be fine on this computer. I think it was only happening on one of my other computers. I will check later today....####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, I still haven't heard anything back as to why you took my money and spent it on something else???####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks you help alot####$$##%POSITIVE
And may I add, Studio is SO MUCH HELP to learning the language!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have yet to find a Simbio game partner. I'm a Portuguese learner, and English speaker.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was nervous too but it was really fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a coaching session with a native speaker. It's not a test. Sometimes it's just you and the coach; other times there are up to four of you, which will yield a slightly different experience. Either way, it's a wonderful way to converse with a native speaker who understands at what level in your learning you are. All of my Studio coaches have been fun and supportive people.####$$##%POSITIVE
Ooooh~! I haven't finished the whole thing yet, but it's really fun! c: At first I was just kinda like.. "...How am I learning anything?" And then I somehow started learning. o: It was weird.####$$##%POSITIVE
Have you tried playing any of the games yet? Yesterday I played 2 games with people from Mexico.  It was fun. It was just typing but I have tried some of the voice games as well.####$$##%POSITIVE
Just did my first duo games. Contrasto is fun!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone is great! It is very effective!  Buy it. You will love it!  I am on level 4 of 5 in their Spanish program.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love mine, and have bought it as a present for my sister who is now learning Japanese####$$##%POSITIVE
It worked just as you said...thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I used Rosetta Stone to learn Hindi so I can speak to my mother-in-law.  Even though they lhave a different alphabet, i am able to read alot of Hindi publications.  The course is easier than any language course I've ever taken, includoing Berlitz.  I think you'll like it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am very pleased and appreciative of each of your answers. Thank you so much for taking the time to give me your input as well as point out the path I need to take in order to learn through Rosetta Stone's Arabic method. I now have a renewed way of looking at the lessons and hope that I can succeed in understanding the basics of both the sounds and the script. Thank You for being there for me ...####$$##%POSITIVE
almost half the price####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did a lot of research about Rocket Languages and Rosetta Stone before purchasing my Rosetta Stone. Rocket is by far cheaper. About half the price. They include beginner, intermediate, and advanced in their 20 disk program. I do like how they have quizzes after each lesson. They also provide a grammar book, but I prefer the rosetta stone "natural" approach to the "classroom" feel. As of right now, rocket only offers like 6 or 7 languages including sign language. The ratings are extremely close, where rocket has 5/5 & RS has 4/5. It really depends on how much you want to spend, your learning type, and what language you want to learn.####$$##%POSITIVE
The thing that bothers me is, I've probably read over 1000 reviews - no exaggeration - about RS, and I've also looked at at least 9 other programs including Rocket Spanish before I made my decision.  Most of the reviews I read about RS including those on Amazon were negative; most likely written when V2 or V3 were out and were not direct purchases from the company.  But despite all of the "unbiased" reviews as they claimed to be, all of them compared [you name the product, I've looked at it - promise and if I haven't, I will be happy to] to RS.  So I thought, "Why would they compare themselves to this other product (RS) so much?'  Then I considered that RS has their 6-month money-back gaurantee.  I read its fine print and when I bought V3 of RS, I was totally ready to take this ~$700 program back in a flash if I was in the least bit unhappy with it.  To this day, a year and a half later, the RS box is still in the UPS shipping box under my desk - I just bumped it with my foot.  I am on level 4 and it has been worth every penny.  Especially since V4 TOTALe has come out.  Also, consider that learning a language without translating more easily allows you to read, comprehend and speak the language in less time.  I hope that helps you Emilio!####$$##%POSITIVE

Same message u send everybody else. I am a trickdriver so I don't get to the library. And my company don't offer stuff like that. And 600 dollars is kinda expensive right now####$$##%NEGATIVE

Ok thanks very much for your quickly answer :) Then I will order now my Rosetta Stone!!! Can't wait to start with learning Dutch.####$$##%POSITIVE
I completed Level 1 of Netherlands and it was awesome, as for the differences I will let someone more qualified answer that one.####$$##%POSITIVE

Wow, appreciate the prompt reply! I'll check it out now. :o)####$$##%POSITIVE
Perfect, thanks.  That's reassuring!####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm just behind you Nancy. I'm just now about half way through unit 4 Level 1. I just love it and study everyday. I've been telling my husband for the past year that I needed RS and he gave it to me for Christmas. We were in Puerto Rico in October and I wasn't able to speak Spanish with the family at all. At least they like to practice their English. I understand alot but not enough to speak. I've only had one semester of Spanish at our local community college and two years of French in HS. Hopefully I'll catch up to you and we've meet in a studio session. I haven't been brave enough to do any games yet.####$$##%POSITIVE
I meant to put a paragraph not stop there. I feel down and disappointed after every live class. I guess that when all of the people who had the luck to take Rosetta Stone when the live classes were 50 minutes finish the course , the new people won't know the difference. But I do know the difference. I  who took 300 live classes don't really want to take any. I am just taking them because I paid for them but I get very little out of them .For that reason, I am paying 2 teachers , one in French and one in Portuguese for lessons on Skype. This is working out well for me but I miss my 50 minute sessions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Absolutely will lose my and my other 2 language subscriptions with only 2 25-minute sessions a month!  Worthless!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!! Also why did lessons get reduced from 1hour to 30 mins? I had my own personal RS, but it expired and wanted more money to continue live lessons......luckily my work now pay for us to enjoy Rosetta stone but I miss the hour lessons####$$##%NEGATIVE
Danke ! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Obrigado!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's the same thing with the Swedish noun "snö" - should be "snöa", the verb.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi - it's not more often if it's limited to 2 sessions a month.  I'm also tired of the canned response about it being "faster and easier to schedule" - I actually liked the old setup better - this one is too limiting as you can't see a full week at a time.  I don't have a problem with the 25-minute sessions, I have a HUGE problem with limiting it to only 2 sessions a month. In essence you are then limiting my learning to one unit a month!####$$##%NEGATIVE
When I signed up the big deal you guys at RS made was that I could go back and repeat any session as many times as I wanted to develop my language skills, but clearly your marketing has changed in order to make clients take more time learning (more months spent on the services) therefore, more $$$ from people after they've spent large sums of money on the initial package.  I am not done with you about this and will take this up with upper management to voice my displeasure!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Don't bother, you could try though. I'm saying this cause I've been through this with them already and all I got was... wait for it.. ONE WHOLE EXTRA SESSION FOR 1 MONTH.. Like I said you could try, hopefully you'll have better luck than I did.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks so much for responding. It's 10.6.8.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi. I am working offline. Does that make a difference? I have the program open (with the slides showing), but don't see my name anywhere. The box for full screen mode isn't checked. I don't see the Max maximize button. Look forward to hearing more...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Okay, thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
Need some help. I just bought the RS program, v 4.5. I have a Mac laptop and the bottom frames of the lesson are cut off. I can't scroll down or change minimize the box. Wondering if anyone can advise?####$$##%NEGATIVE
To be more clear, I am having problems getting the program to display on my laptop screen. I believe my screen is 12". Thanks!####$$##%NEGATIVE
As I told the tech before... WHen I click on that, it doesn't allow me to activate anything. my code is in pale gray and you can't click to retype it. WHen I click activate, a very quick window shows saying please wait and then it goes away.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i tried... i uninstalled.. and then it let me register. however, it says my activation code is invalid and might have been used on another computer. I have the code for spanish 1,2, 3 and also the homeschool code..which is what i'm trying to use since i have 3 kids. now what do i do?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh no!  We were going to get it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Studio is only 2 sessions per month.  Each session is 25 minutes in length.  For me, the big draw was being able to speak with a native speaker.  It is a big drawback to only get about an hour a month and in a group setting.  THe private lessons are $40 a session (25 minutes).  I don't know how popular they are.  Also, they offer a canned response when people say that 2 sessions a month is not enough.  I beleive that people need to use the language as much as possible, so they need to get to a meetup or find a language partner to get that extra practice.  It is not coming from RS at this point in time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I miss the unlimited sessions.  I could get on board if they increased the the sessions to 4 a month.  $40 for 25 minutes is a big jump.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta World is a good option for those taking popular languages.  I never once found a fellow Swedish learner there with whom to play the games.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I definitely loved the studio sessions as I tried to average 2 sessions per unit.  I do like the shorter times as sometimes the 50 minute sessions did drag.  Also, many people experienced technical problems that took them out of studio sessions.  I would be upset if I were removed due to a technical issue and that counted towards my 2 per month.  Maybe they could cap the studios at 2 per unit.####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh wow they have Hebrew!!!! Don't tell me that!!!  I may have to become trilingual. Lol####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for answering but the fact still is that I never reacted to your advertisement and therefore your posted statement is a "Non Truth". Wahrheit währt am Längsten!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

My husband gave me the Italian Totale for my birthday.  What an awesome gift!!  I am already thinking in Italian.  WOW just awesome.####$$##%POSITIVE
glad I dodged that bullet####$$##%NEGATIVE
So lets see 50 min month 4 people in a class 12.5 min a person how much can one focus in 12.5 min? Buy the way if you can not connect at class time you loss that session. Would you address this? Or not in the canned script. You told know one of the change. All cost cutting for Rosetta Stone not good for the students.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My question WAS if I could find your product for sale in Hermosillo, Sonora. Mexico. Your website doesn't provide that info :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
i couldn't get past the rude person who was going to take my order.  I am going with Pimsleur.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Andrew Carducci, you are spot on! Rosetta Stone is a terrific addendum to a formal curriculum. Experience in a native speaking country would be icing on the cake...####$$##%POSITIVE
The mike and voice recognition suck####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am from italy and i moved to america. i am tryin to teach my friends italian and it has made it harder with rosetta stone ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I speak fluent italian and find the accents to be highly insulting and steriotypical. i am willing to file an lawsuit in order to get them changed####$$##%NEGATIVE

I am also learning how to speak italian and its going awesome. I have been to italy one time and its beautiful. Che Bella!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Ordered Thai 1 early this year, spent a total of 9 hours over 3 phone calls. First they couldn't fins my certified cheque then they found it and cashed it. Haven't received my product or a return phone call. Very unhappy with customer service to say the least.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Russian levels 1-3 are awesome! I mean I don't feel like I can land in Moscow tomorrow and feel comfortable unless I was buying eggs or riding a white horse but the program is certainly a good start! I lived in Germany for 3 years as a teenager. The concept of submersion is ideal!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree, too!  2 a month is a slap in the face to those of us who truly want to learn to speak the language, and have successfully used your product in the past.  Maybe, you can limit it to a maximum of 2 studios for a certain level.  For example, if you take the studio after the first two lessons in unit 1, you can only do that studio twice and then you HAVE to move on.  I think that is a better system than two a month.  Also, you should "lock" the future studios so that a person, once they complete the two studios at that point, they have to move on to the next one in sequence. Someone needs to listen to the complaints and do more than write 'canned" responses.  When people are disgruntled,hey let others know.  NOwadays, with the advent of online social networks, that could really hurt your bottom line.####$$##%NEGATIVE
How to connect my purchase with the iPad app and how to get headphones working on a Mac? They work with other programs but not RS####$$##%NEGATIVE
Couldn't agree more. In fact I have started discouraging my friends from buy Rosetta Stone. Bear in mind that they also cut the length of the session in half. So by the old metric, we're only getting 1 session a month (ie, 1 hour a month). I understand that the old system was not sustainable and that there was a need to limit the sessions, and I'd understand a limit of one or two hours a week (which I think is what the average learner would use), but this is ridiculous. Oh well, I'll start looking elsewhere as well. So long, RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've seen this canned response in many places. Please keep in mind that the sentence: "... encouraging you to speak faster and more often than if there were only one Session" is INACCURATE, since you claim we can speak the language "more often" and yet you limited the sessions to TWO A MONTH!  I have no issue with shorter sessions, but I do have an issue with only two a month.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta stone The lessons should be easier to scheduled 1 hour month WOW EASY. No notes to users what a scam you run. Furthermore my son was in an accident I missed my class yet you Rosetta stone Counted that as my class WHAT A RIP. Marry XMAS to all the jobs you cut.####$$##%NEGATIVE
50 minutes a MONTH?  I am very disappointed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So if you pay $25.00 for a month 50 minutes of class 4 people in the class that is 12.50 minuets a person or $100 a hour for class time. You better really focus-on that 12.5 minuets of  new and great content####$$##%NEGATIVE
I really think that the whole customer service department just bottomed out once Jay left.  I don't know who is running it, but I have NEVER heard of a successful company making major changes and not informing current and future customers.  Also, RS needs to dump the canned response, or at least have someone write a new one!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
25 minutes to cover 2 units is not a good thing.  25 minutes to cover 1 unit would be fair.  2 25 minute studios for each unit would be better.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I know, isn't the canned response a hoot!  You would think that they would at least change it as so many have been against the limitation of the studios.  I think that a limit of 4 per unit would be ok.  Two after the 2nd lesson and 2 after the 4th lesson.  The studios should "unlock" like the online stories and games.  If there are any more changes, they should ensure that everyone knows about it before the change.  It is unprofessional to change the terms without letting your customers know.  WHy would you want to alienate your customers? Whoever made that call should be fired (after they are tarred and feathered).####$$##%NEGATIVE
Actually, since they allow 2 sessions per unit (one after lesson 2 and the other after lesson 4) , I believe that they should allow 4 per unit.  Two for the studios after lesson 2 and 2 for the studios after lesson 4.  THey should unlock like the stories.  In this way, no one can jump ahead, and once you do the two studios at your level, you MUST continue on.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed. I'm not happy about that, and I won't be buying TotalE as a result when my trial expires.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Canned response how touching. Rosetta stone is the source of the frustration. Why did you for the most part cut out the class's there dead you killed them. o only to cost cutting####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thx! Yes that's what I meant, the companion and studio. My bad. Great to know! With that info, I'm leanin towards the mini :D####$$##%POSITIVE
The first one was resolved, but the second one is 3217. i am unable to fix it because the direction tell me to do something that the computer doesnt have. and when i uninstall rosetta and reinstall it, it remembers me and i continue to receive the error message####$$##%NEGATIVE
I see you have gotten the same treatment as me. Lousy support####$$##%NEGATIVE
well, lets hope you never need support from RS....####$$##%NEGATIVE
hard to believe, since RS support left me hanging with software that doesnt work. And they are ok with that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Try calling again. A couple of years ago, I did not receive an acceptable resolution to my particular problem. This led to my desperate move to purchase what I thought was "the real deal" on ebid for $116 plus shipping. Well, this ended up to be a very professional looking pirated version. This had no license agreement, an application disc for the homeschool version and no ability to legally make it work. Thankfully, paypal resolved that issue. I called Rosetta Stone to "bite the bullet" and see if I could purchase Levels 1 and 2 in the same version as my own Level 3. After trying to deal with the weekend staff from India, I called the more local weekday staff during regular business hours. A precious guy named Brad upgraded all three of my levels in version 4 with the 3 free months for $124. I hope this information helps you get the same satisfying resolution as I experienced. I am again a believer. The course is amazing and helped immeasurably in conversations with relations in Brazil.####$$##%POSITIVE
Then consider me a lost customer. Returning the product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone - I would credit the $161 to the customer and have them telling everyone how great you guys are - instead you have me wondering if it's worth it to take a chance with a company who doesn't stand behind their own product regardless of the seller or reseller.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've had great customer service with Groupon!  Sorry you're having to go through this hassle, though.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love Groupon - they are great - apparently Rosetta Stone is the one lacking.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks!  Honestly it's hard to pick. Rosetta Course is fun and addictive. I actually have to force myself to stop to get other things done (like sleep. lol). But I also enjoy the ability to play games and speak with native speakers. It really reinforces the lessons. I'd say you can't have 1 without the other. I love all 3.####$$##%POSITIVE
that's still to high girl.  your marketing team should start some kinda discount club with this.  too expensive but really need it though.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have one already it really works my Spanish is getting a lot better####$$##%POSITIVE
Love!####$$##%POSITIVE
Well let me get a job then first. Cuz I'm a democrat so holding to funds to pay for this just ain't happenings.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ITS STILL TO STUPID EXPENSIVE! Make it like 50$ and then you'll see it fly off the shelves. Come on, not everything has to cost an arm and a leg.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Glad I didn't buy it last year, whew!####$$##%POSITIVE
I love RS but i dont like that new policy of limited to 2 25m sessions per month when before there was no limit & I was able to interact with the teachers as much as I liked to..####$$##%NEGATIVE
okay thanks i'll check into it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Can you delete me from this. Facebook feed???####$$##%NEGATIVE
This most definitely isn't your best deal ever.  I received an email from you about 6 hours ago quoting $324 for all 5 levels.####$$##%NEGATIVE
There you go again RS! Can't you just be honest and up front with potential customers? Of course, it's cheaper than last year's product because IT ISN'T THE SAME as the product you offered last year. Really, pretty simple....studio time (people time) has gone from unlimited 50 min. sessions to 2 - 25 min. sessions / month. If you want more studio time it'll cost you $40 / 50 min. Private Studio session. RS:  Pls don't reply with your canned response about how customers really, really wanted 25 min. sessions...blah, blah. It's kind of sad to see, what was once a well respected language learning company, loose sight of it's customer's goals of really learning a language and replacing it with deceptive marketing programs and a slowing down of a learner's progress with monthly studio time limits. I have to ask why? Anyone? Purchase many months of online access when the 3 mo. trial ends? Hmmmm....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Two per month? Very disappointing. Is that per calendar month or per 30 days? I assume, if I spent more than 5 minutes with technical support, the class is refunded and added to the sum.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am with Cheryl on this one, and RS you did not give us any explanation, please, reach out to your management team and let them know that your customers are not happy and starting to look at other options.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The sale price for the American English software is already over, after having been up for only about 24 hours or so, even though the sale price extends for ANOTHER FIVE DAYS! What gives, Rosetta Stone? Some of us can't afford the regular $500 price. And yet for some reason, your sales agents can still take the orders for it at $350.   I'd rather not have to give my credit card number over the phone, so can't you guys just put the website price back to $350?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Bring back the unlimited Studio sessions!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please let Rosetta Stone know that you would like them to bring back unlimited Studio sessions!####$$##%NEGATIVE
For the price of rosetta stone. The decision to limit the studio session unacceptable.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please bring back the unlimited Studio sessions or at least increase it to one Studio for every Unit totaling 4 Studios per Level.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ive done one year of spanish and I cant speak it and I dont understand it if someone else is speaking so I have no idea .####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please bring back unlimited Studio sessions!####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank u .... i will try that and ill let u know####$$##%POSITIVE
It worked thanks a lot####$$##%POSITIVE
I just love how it's so simple and efficient to learn a language naturally without translation. And it's the same method we used when growing up. I took a language class my freshmen year which was a Spanish class and it was so confusing for me to learn a language. Yet when I started trying out Rosetta Stone, I couldn't believe how I could understand so much so quickly! But I don't have the actual program myself and would love to buy it soon. I want to learn Chinese Mandarin first.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sí, yo quiero también el Rosetta Stone. :) Tengo el español, inlgés y árabe. :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Oh YES! Thank you very much :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes it does, thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Bring back unlimited Studio sessions!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you Rosetta Stone! you are very helpful####$$##%POSITIVE
really? thats super cool. thanks for the feed back####$$##%POSITIVE
That video doesn't say how there are only two 30 minute sessions a month you get with the online service, and how you have to BUY more classes if you want more time.... There you go misleading your customers again...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm not being rude here Lesie, but Rosetta Stone did nothing to resolve my issue.  I had to mess around and do things such as that suggested by Johnatan to fix it on my own.  There are no good forums or FAQs dealing with these things and customer service is very poor.  This was not the only problem I had either.  I had to fix the update functionality before I even got this far.  So far I'm not impressed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cool, how much?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
My program was working well  Your darn "upgrade" prevents the head set from working and locks up the program  No i have to spend hours researching what the problem is  I will make sure everybody knows about your uipgrade and the *success* we are with yous assitance in solving problems that you introduced!  I was told to change the code but NOBODY will tel me how (even after 2 hours on your famous chat problem solving room)  Get me someone that will read my question, maybe understand my question at least answer my question####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was told to change the access code but after two hours on your "success" chat room nobody woud read or understand or answer my question on how to do it. Rather disappointing rather than success####$$##%NEGATIVE
now i have to check all these websites to find a solution for a problem you created by "upgrading" my program So much for customer service.####$$##%NEGATIVE
so now they blame it on the security program!!! Thank you very much for reaching out!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have to say, I wouldn't buy any program that says it needs to be exempted from my computer security program: recipe for disaster.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No thanks, will NOT get ripped off by Rosetta Stone again!  And will try and let as many others know how greedy you people are ... :o(####$$##%NEGATIVE
A success story it is not!####$$##%NEGATIVE
well if you are a programmer i guess it works####$$##%NEGATIVE
Absolutely true. I spend whole of my day on computer. That is really help me and I can't remember words without picture but Rosetta Stone teach the word with picture. Very helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
better hang out for a long time since it will not work####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think that it is a huge customer service problem inthat they limit the Us market and not overseas markets. At least that is what I have heard. Why did they not limit everyone?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wait...When I return to Buenos Aires...I can do unlimited again?####$$##%NEGATIVE
problem is, the course works but the program does not####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm learning Italian with RS. I'm in Level 5 Unit 2 and will be finished in a couple of months.  RS worked well for me but that was mostly due to Studio; in fact, that's what sold me on RS because at the time (2010) they were the only ones who offered live sessions. That being said, Studio used to be awesome.  The sessions were 50 minutes long and you could take as many as you wanted; many times I took two or three a week.   I hate the 25 minute sessions.  Had one recently with three other students, and got to speak for maybe two minutes because one guy dominated the class and the coach didn't do anything about it.  I was going to buy the Spanish software after I finish Italian but I'll look elsewhere since other products now offer online sessions.  $99 for six 25 minutes Studio sessions is outrageous when it used to be $150 for 15 months of unlimited 50 minute sessions.  I'm just guessing here, but I bet they've had a change in management.  Seems to me that whenever a good company changes something that works well into something awful for no apparent reason, it's because they've gotten a new CEO who thinks he knows what his customers want without bothering to ask them.  I hope I'm wrong, but this really sounds like a clueless suit's idea.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I haven't found that scheduling is easier.  I guess that it depends on the language. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I dare say you were no help at all, I decided to erase the program then re-install it even that did not work.  One more hour with the super helpful but totally ineffective success people did not do it.  So with some thinking and lots of trying i figured out the answer to the question I have been asking your experts for days without success!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, he said "NOT" twice. I can not not understand. Well, they sometimes use the du familiar because they were in a familiar environment talking with each other. They're right close to each other in a familiar environment and he's addressing a child with the familiar form because kids his age often use that form when communicating with each other, they use it around family members in the same house.  So, I do not see why using "du" in front of Santa addressing a child like that is a problem because adults express it around children alot because they need to familiarize themselves with them and express it directly in a sort of private setting among kids, so actually using "Du" would be correct in this instance.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That is ridiculous. They really need to get better tech supprt. For a company that has an expensive discretionary product,  they can't seem to understand that people do not have to spend their hard-earned money on this product. There are just too many problems with tech support, limitations on use,  customer support,  etc. It doesn't seem as though they value their customers. Very sad. . . ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am going on 90 minutes with the online tech support####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have requested a supervisor twice to no avail####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow - if you aren't  getting anywhere with them and ask for a supervisor,  that should be a no-brainer for them. Put on a supervisor! When people in retail or customer service do that,  I get a bad feeling about their product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It took nearly 3 hours but I did get the issue resolved.  But, I have to tell you, I was scared when they took control of my laptop and asked me to try to find the old activation code on the TextEdit program...which was just page after page of computer code.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Got this done (thanks), then when I logged in it said my online trail was already expired. I only got it installed and used today. I purchased the suit in August of this year.####$$##%POSITIVE
Probably a bit late here, but getting "Rosetta Stone" installed on a Mac and actually working, and especially with OS X Lion and Mountain Lion has been a PITA for many users and you might want to get your money back.

rrgg.  i have just had my own horrible experience with rosetta stone customer service.  customer annoyance is more like it.  understand you are trying to protect your intellectual property, but your scratch off activation codes are ridiculous as is the wait time and excuses for it at your tech support.  i really don't care if you've sold so much rosetta stone you don't have enough employees to answer all the questions they have.  hire more employees.  it is what the rest of us in the world do to make a living.####$$##%NEGATIVE

we love RS!####$$##%POSITIVE
I cant to do this ....i was buying and they say is only for USA. I dont understand ! Anybody here know if is possible to others country? thank you####$$##%NEGATIVE
This change has killed Rosetta Stone. 50min of practice/month is less than useless for anyone trying to gain fluency in a language. Also, considering you can easily clear 1 lesson per week, by the time you get to the next month you'd be 6+ sessions behind. I love the program, but won't be recommending it to anyone anymore.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My opinion is that they're just being greedy with it.. no matter how you look at it, you're barely getting 50 minutes a month of real practice in and that's divided with other people. Then they want you to buy more private classes... It's ridiculous..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Completely agree. Currently I am many units ahead (in the course) of my progress in studio because of this outrageous policy. This policy constrains the progress to one unit a month! That's 20 months to complete all 5 levels! This may be okay for some, but for the more motivated learners, it's unacceptable. I also feel duped because I didn't see  anything about this policy when extending my subscription.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I felt duped also - saw no indication of the policy change until after I renewed.  I felt they were not being up front with customers about this change.####$$##%NEGATIVE
To add insult to injury, the studio icon on the top right corner keeps telling me "READY TO SCHEDULE" but won't let me do just that!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's awfully restrictive and, unfortunately, I fear that RS have cut their noses off to spite their faces with this one.   RS is a fantastic product, which I believe in dearly, but my loyalty to the company is disappearing. Fast. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's within a 30 day time period, not the 1st of every month but whatever day of the month your subscription expires..####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, there's no roll over. If you don't use them for the month you lose them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
its a pain in my tits####$$##%NEGATIVE
I felt that way up to now - however, they recently changed their policy and limit subscribers only 2 studio sessions per month - really diminishes the product value in my opinion.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with John.  I love immersion because it gets you to think in the language.  The studios were the true value of the program.  How else are you going to speak and understand the language without structured practice?  The private lessons that they offer may be ok for some people, but the program itself is expensive and shelling out more for the lessons is not a good customer service tactic. They are out-pricing themselves.  Also, if the private sessions are like the studio sessions - a different coach each session - then that diminishes the value of the private sessions.  I would rather get someone face-to-face, if possible, or join a meet-up or a university club.  If I took private lessons for a language through RS, I would take one block of lessons, and then move on to find native-speakers in my area.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with John and Janice.  There was no "full disclosure" on that fact until after I had purchased the product.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree.  I believe that it would be better with a limit of two of the same studios for any one session.  A person can now take a studio after lesson 2 and lesson 4.  The studios should unlock after you complete the required coursework, and then you should only be limited to two studios (or 4 per unit).  I think that management should start to listen to their regular customers.  Many new customers may not know of the changes, but there are enough on-going customers to let them know!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think two per week is a reasonable limit - 2 per month is way too restrictive - having been doing studio sessions for a while, I feel the sessions are a valuable part of the learning experience.####$$##%NEGATIVE
2 per month is very restrictive for someone to really progress in the language.  This is especially true if they are really motivated.  I think that the private lessons are a nice offering, but I don't think that many people are going to take them based on the price of the product and the additional price of the private lessons.  People want to see value for their money, and the studio sessions added value to the product and the overall language-learning experience.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would not recommend any of there products while they support bigoted Limbaugh. Lets increase the awareness!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!  I'll try it out.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Kristina - the whole 2 studios a month thing really sucks.  I think that most people are not going to pay for private lessons.  I can't imagine continuing to pay extra for private lessons over the computer.  I would rather pay for face to face time with a native speaker.  Also, you can join a meetup and practice with native speakers and others.  I think that you should be able to take studios when you are ready and that they should unlock when you are ready with a limit of two at each point.  Good luck with your language studies!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree Janice. RS is misleading people by saying they can do studio more often with the new two per unit. You have to go slowly to only do two studios a month. So I just won't be able to do studios for every two lessons. I'll have to skip some studios because I'm not paying extra. When I did Greek I bought each level separately so I got three months online each time and I finished each level in 3 months. I couldn't have done that if I went as slow as they expect now. I hope they change!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm no longer going to recommend RS because they've gotten too greedy. Please change this new policy! People don't like it! I see lots of poor feedback online.####$$##%NEGATIVE
..and there are other programs that are jumping onto the online tutor bandwagon.  Some offer a year of free online services with the cost of the program.  Also, some of these programs actually offer classes to teach grammar, etc without translation.  RS needs to re-evaluate their policies as their product is not a necessity of life (like, say food, clothing), and people can take their hard-earned $$ elsewhere!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree, it makes it nothing like the product it was. When did this change happen?####$$##%NEGATIVE
This change happened in October.  They announced that they were reducing the studios to 25 minutes and that they would start after lesson 2 and after lesson 4 instead of just at the end of each unit.  I agree that for anyone who is really interested in learning to speak a language, 2 studios a month at 25 minutes per studio is a slap in the face and too much of a "teaser".  I don't think that the new "suits" are interested in what the customers want - if they were, they would have surveyed those existing customers to know the value that we place on the studios.  The studios were the most interesting part of the program and really gave RS a leg up.  There are now competing programs that offer tutors and their "suits" have a better understanding of language learning.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Absolutely. It's poor show from a company who charge a lot of money; I certainly won't be renewing my totale subscription once it expires; that's for sure. I'll be signing up to a local class where I can chat away to my heart's content for three hours a week!  Coincidentally, does anyone know what's happened to the Compass group? It seems to have fallen into silence since Jay left the company...surely the studio limit would never have gotten through if the idea had been floated to Compass members first, to "test the waters", so to speak...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think that the company's response to customers has diminished since Jay left.  The Compass program was just getting off of the ground, but I think that with the change in upper management, it is not longer a priority. I cannot believe that a company with such a discretionary product would put into place a policy that alienates their regular customers and not respond quickly to the backlash!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've already tried the "LIVE CHAT".  Hopeless.  Just told me to check date on computer and then couldn't help further and told me to come back two days later.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The website says that if you cancel more than 24 hours in advance it won't count as used. I'm just trying to spread them out since you can't do one every two lessons unless you go really slow. So I'm going to have to do them every four lessons to spread it out.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good grief! This new studio policy is utter tripe. What on earth are Rosetta Stone doing?!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Kristina - I have already posted a number of times about this.  Limit of 2 per month stinks.   I have been using Studio regularly and found it to be a big help - but won't help much at 2 per month!  Furthermore, I feel that Rosetta Stone was not very straightforward with customers in making this change.  I found out about it after renewing - I saw no notification or warning of this limit being instituted.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not my first post either since finding out. I was much happier with Rosetta Stone last year. Maybe if they were going to limit sessions (because they want more money), they could at least open the possibility to buy more group sessions per month instead of only private sessions which are ridiculously expensive. I'm a real teacher and don't get paid that much an hour.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Two 25 sessions a month is useless. So much better before. Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so. I want the real practice back.####$$##%NEGATIVE
We need to figure that out!  BTW, I just found out the limitation is restricted to US customers only!####$$##%NEGATIVE
@jonathan Any reason why only US customers have the limit? Where'd you find that out?   I'm totally down for a petition as well, its a bit irritating and discouraging for someone who's dedicated to making progress in learning a language be limited to REAL practice with the program.. sorry but games in Rosetta World really don't do it for me, as I can't fit them around my work schedule anyways, so the studio sessions really are all I have. Same goes for game nights, because I work overnight. I've already explained the changes rs made with this to friends of mine I used to recommend this to and it changed their perception of the entire program immensely.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes - they are pushing the private classes.  I might take some on a more difficult language, but I would prefer the interaction with other students.  They are losing loyal customers who have used their products for a while and highly recommended them to others.  What about a petition?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes. In fact, I feel like writing to their MD####$$##%NEGATIVE
Too late!!! I returned the Kindle HD! I was online with one of your (very well mannered and most helpful) techs, but they couldn't figure it out either.  My time is way too precious to be spending it  trying to figure out a $600.00 gardget!!!  Thank you anyway, Jonathan!####$$##%NEGATIVE
GRAZIE!!####$$##%POSITIVE
The new Studio policy is ludicrous.   Rosetta Stone is, in itself, an expensive product, although one which I believe to be a sound investment. The box sets (I have only ever bought the CDs, as I want to own the product forever) are good value, as you can pace yourself and pick up the course to fit in with your daily life, without experience the pressure of subscription 'ticking on' when life gets busy.  I have previously subscribed online for 18 months, in total (I think) for German but categorically will not be renewing my online rights, nor ever will again for any of the other three languages I own. The Studio Sessions are extremely helpful, but not when restricted to two lessons per month. More frequent practice than this is needed - especially at the prices they charge! I even found out today that a lesson cancelled within 24hrs of its occurrence counts as one from your allowance, even though you never have the lesson because you cancelled it.  Rosetta Stone used to be a fantastic company which I whole-heartidly supported. Now, I still support the product, but am questioning the motives of the company itself. They do not appear to be listening to their customers; I haven't seen a single positive comment from any user on here about the limited sessions; it's not what we want....LISTEN!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I purchased French, the version going all the way through level 5. Very expensive piece of software. Software that is awful! I am attempting to set my software up on a fresh, windows 8 machine; and it will not work. Rosetta Stone support is awful. Now I'm reading that the online training is not what I was led to believe? What a joke.  All of a sudden I need to remember why I purchased this software in the first place. I can say, this will be the last Rosetta Stone software I purchase, that seems to be for sure.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im very upset no one will respond online or on the website####$$##%NEGATIVE
not a good beginning!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is an AWESOME program. I haven't used it nearly as much as I should. It is easy to follow and the level of difficulty increases as you master each section. I was, too, a skeptic; however, I have become a believer after using it. It's worth every penny. It is very textbook and I prefer to learn that way.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you christy for your help ^^####$$##%POSITIVE
The RS Success site recommends that a learner schedule a studio session after core lesson 2 and core lesson 4 for each unit. This is THEIR recommendation! There are 4 units in a level meaning that there are 8 studio sessions that are specific to each level. I would take a learner 4 months to complete a level. Hmmm, every wonder why the "'free online accsess'' is for only 3 months?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have posted about this a number of times over the past week - this 2 sessions per month change is a big dis-service to their customers - noone from Rosetta Stone has responded to posts by me or others about this!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just wanted to say that still no DM an hour later.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you.  I appreciate your help/####$$##%POSITIVE
I wonder if they take any if these comments seriously. It takes about an hour to do a lesson and its follow up activities and I'm supposed to make that last a week so that it takes half a month to get to a studio session? I'd rather go back to the old way of one 50 minute session per unit. Maybe too many people were repeating sessions. Just don't let them repeat but let them study at their own pace at take studio sessions when they want. They are lying when they say it is more frequent. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
I suggested that they offer two studio sessions for each session that you take - in other words the studio after lesson 2, you can take twice and no more.  The studios after that would unlock after you complete the coursework,  In this manner, you don't have people taking too many studios.  They may want an option to buy more studios, if you want more practice.  I think that they should get rid of the private lessons, or at least not make them the priority.  I don't think that they are very popular as the product is already rather highly priced.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah and I don't want private lessons. I just want to do the studio sessions as I finish lessons. I did two a month with Greek when they were at the end of the unit and now I'm supposed to only do two when they offer two per unit! Now I just have to do them after each unit and skip the ones after lesson 2 and they are half as long! Not an improvement.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think I've heard your advertising on the Stern show? If so, I definitely will recommend! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I feel betrayed by Rosetta Stone for cutting down the studio sessions. I have purchased multiple programs and recommended the set to countless friends, many of which went on to buy their product. No more. Studio was an essential component of the program, and Rosetta Stone needs change this policy (and soon!). At the very least they should release a public statement addressing this issue.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have...and you are correct..for 350$ your on your own####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah its pretty much the same, as in not much activity going on.. whenever I log on there's no one ever playing games, and most of the time the chat messenger feature is all in English instead of Spanish.. plus the new studio limitations definitely aren't worth renewing for..####$$##%NEGATIVE
What do you mean by studio limitations? I completely forgot about those, they helped me. What's changed with them?####$$##%NEGATIVE
They were cut to 25min (so two studios per unit instead of one) and you can only do 2 a month (i.e., 50min/month, or one studio by the old metric). This means your progress is limited to one unit a month if you want to do the studio along with Rosetta Course. :/ A lot of people is upset with this (including me), and RS hasn't address this issue here, other than by saying that they appreciate the feedback and have forwarded the issue to the dev team.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I don't believe that the people at RS really understand the value that language learners place on actually hearing and speaking (responding) .  The best part of the program was the studios and the other parts of Rosetta World were a good supplement.  Without the studios, RS falls backwards and in line with other products that do not offer that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Maybe there are two sessions per unit, but that is it for the month.  If a person wants to work through the program more quickly than a unit a month, the studios are not available.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's horrible! I am def. not buying the package then, thanks for the support guys!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yea, I'm not renewing either!! :/  (BTW, I assumed you're in the US. This policy is for US customers only!)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Me too! I love Arabic and this is really helping with my vocabulary and grammar. I'm addicted I'm on it constantly. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
i have also tried a different email address, when i change password, it says please enter the original password, so it must be something to do with the software not changing over???####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, please note that if you cancel a studio session within 24 hours of its scheduled time, you forfeit one of that month's studios.  I didn't know that until I saw it on this site.  In my opinion, the best part of the online subscription is the studio session.  It had the greatest value.  There are other options to play games and talk to native speaker online.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Christy ... thanks for your reply.   My security system is updated each time I power the PC up.   What concerns me is the file was automatically deleted.    At some point I assume I will hit that file and my RS software will crash, no?####$$##%NEGATIVE
One would think those exclusions would be stated before the software is loaded.   I really appreciate your help.   My software is up and appears to be running fine but one particular file was deleted as malicious.    Help me understand, why would scanning software that is updated daily identify a file as a specific virus pattern if no viral pattern exists?   Appreciate it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I didn't think about flash scrips.   Thanks for all you advice, Jonathan! Randy####$$##%POSITIVE
I loved the sessions, but now that you had reduced them to twice a month, their benefit, to my opinion is almost completely demonished.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Miri's comment is right on the mark - Studio sessions for me were a major factor in making good language progress - limiting the sessions to two per month will destroy a valuable piece of the Rosetta Sone product  - really lowers Rosetta Stone value significantly!####$$##%NEGATIVE
hey thanks... i sure will listen####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your offer to help.  Two more calls with offshore support were not able to solve my problem, but eventually I was able to troubleshoot the issue myself.  Not what I would call as shining moment for my first experience with RS tech support.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for acknowledging my comment and the fact that he and his show are divisive, and worse. I did not expect to see a response from this company, truth be known. I'd be interested in knowing the full extent of any firm's business relationship with this person, who is a canker sore on the silky gluteal cheek  of life. This man is really no good to anybody, and I will not ever do business with any firm who supports him in any way, he is an ultimate creep. I think your products are quite good, and I have also mastered the art of learning languages on my own by now. I appreciate the reply.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the reply.  I will check out the site.####$$##%POSITIVE
I do not understand why they did not tell people about the changes.  We heard about what they deemed to be positive - shorter studios and sooner - but they failed to tell us about the limit of two per month and that cancelling within 24 hours of your studio voids one of your studios for the month.  Those two items were essential for people to make an educated decision on the product.  The canned response to people's comments is annoying.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have stated before that they need to allow the studios when you finish the particular lessons that correspond to that studio.  They can limit you to two at each point.  They can also offer more studios for a certain price.  I think that more people would buy additional studios than the private lessons.  Also, in the future, RS needs to ask their customers for feedback when they are going to make major changes to the product.  As a non-essential product, they can really hurt their bottom line by not doing so.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They may just "ride it out" with the hopes that they will not have to change anything.  At some point, they may believe that people will just accept it and shut up.  Hopefully, they are not that short-sighted because it will really hurt them in the long run - not just those who are unhappy with the changes, but those who are just unhappy with the 2 sessions per month. It isn't even an hour per month!! Why emphasize conversational fluency when you take away one of the main ways to gain that fluency? Also, I don't like the idea of just dealing with native speakers in Rosetta World.  I think that we all know that just because someone is a native speaker of a language doesn't mean that they truly know why things are said that way that they are (or that they use grammar they way that we are learning). It may be more of a hindrance than a help.. . . . .####$$##%NEGATIVE
Though I really disliked when a RS rep would post a canned message regarding studio, I think I prefer it to the complete radio silence we're getting.  How hard can it be to tell us if they are (seriously) considering altering this policy and WHEN we should learn more about it. If this policy is here to stay, I'm ready to jump ship. I just want to know what the deal is.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You're right. Sometimes they post a response saying "we'll pass it along, blah blah" Before they would try to convince you that the change was actually beneficial to you! They would claim that now we can do  more studios since there're two studios per unit, as opposed to one! That was truly frustrating.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I really don't think that the reps that respond on this page can answer in a way other than the canned responses.  They really don't have the "clout" to change anything.  I think that I am going to set up a page to get everyone together so that we, the customers, can get organized with the issues we have with the company.  Will let you know. . . .####$$##%NEGATIVE
Fantastic!  Will check it out tonight!  Gracias####$$##%POSITIVE
OMG, thank you. I replied to the email with the required information. You've made this crappy day a bit better! lol####$$##%POSITIVE
Oops... By listening I am able to notice little words I miss in the conversation. This is a great learning program.####$$##%POSITIVE
So far so good, it's amazing how much i still know after not using it for so long####$$##%POSITIVE
thats too bad I was really hoping for one. No Worries, I'll figure something out####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, never... They host game nights every now and then but I'm never able to attend because I work overnight.. And they should find a way to disable English in the chat box.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As far as I can tell, the only game night involvement from RS is to post the date.  Host would imply that native speaking RS employees are available to actively organize games between participants or actually participate in games with language learning gamers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Janice!####$$##%POSITIVE
Since I started with Level 5, I have been getting error code 4111 sometimes with the message "A Minor Error has Occurred".  When this happens, I can't complete the session involved since the next screen after the message gets bypassed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Lesie - thanks for following up on this.  I have Norton Security software.  I tried excluding Adobe and Rosetta Stone folders from Norton, as suggested on your site, but the problem still occurred.  That is why I tried to initiate a chat support contact.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Simy - I have had great experience with Studio sessions also as a learner (French).  However, Rosetta Stone has changed the Studio policy and online users can only do Studio sessions twice per month now! Not good.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It would have been nice if they had run the studio changes by the Compass group before instituting them.  Some of their changes are detrimental to language learning - especially what they advertise - so it would have helped them greatly to get feedback from their regular customers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't think they care what we think. No one would have wanted the sessions limited to 25 minutes nor, of course, not to 2 sessions a month. So it was not up for discussion.  Anybody who has used the program a lot knows how indispensable the live interactions with the coach and the other students is. I would pay more if it is a matter of money causing these drastic changes.  They are saving money. However, in the big picture, I think limiting the studios to 2 half hours a month should not let them have that video put on Jan 8th describing the studios and not mentioning the limits and I think they will lose clients in the end. They are very close to being just like other online programs. It was the studios that made the difference. What a shame. I really feel so sad about it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sadly, you are correct Judy.  They don't care what we think. They thank us for reaching out but they don't really mean thank you in the traditional sense of thank you.   None of this negative feedback is a surprise to them.  The support / success people seem well prepared to deal with it. It was a calculated business decision. They were or are losing money. They are just riding out the small storm right now.  Really, a few people begging for support or taking them to task for their secretive, deceptive business practices? Just a small price to pay to keep the stockholders happy... for now.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Repeating my objection, the ability to use my tablet for the version I purchased was highly touted by the Rosetta Stone sales person (yes, I purchased directly from Rosetta Stone). It turns out I do not have what I was promised.  My access on my tablet "expired" and can only be renewed at additional charge.  I feel cheated.  The responses to my post do nothing to change that view.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I found that most of the sales people are not well versed in the product - the ins and outs.  I had a conversation about a year ago with the manager of one of the local RS outlets, and I knew more about the product and the "rules" than he did!  The outgoing manager gave him some "tips", but he didn't do additional research, and there hadn't been (at that time) any training for him.  It is a pity.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you! please do :3####$$##%POSITIVE

Thank you I'll try them.####$$##%POSITIVE
Shane - I have had the same experience.  Their response about "old" customers is ridiculous.  The reason the "old" customers are complaining is they realize the value of the Studio sessions from having had the chance to use them more than twice per month.  New users have no way to tell what they are missing!  Two per month is not helpful!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree that the studio sessions were the most helpful part of Rosetta Stone. I think you will lose business and money when you do start this because this is what set RS apart from all of the other language programs that are out there. When is this starting?  I just recommended the program to someone else 2 days ago and I will call her today and hopefully she did not sign up yet and will advise her not to.  What happens to people who bought sessions with the idea that they were unlimited for the next year a I have. Will you break that deal with me or will I be able to get my money back?  I will be calling today to find that out. I used to be the biggest advocate that Rosetta Stone ever had. That is over. The new CEO has come up with ideas that eventually will be the ruin of it if he is trying to make RS into a better business. He is running it into the ground. When Jay Topper was there, although I understand he was not the CEO, we felt special and cared for. We felt a real sense that he was looking with every fiber in his being  for ways to improve the program. Now we have a power to be that seems bent on ruining all the good there was about the program. As a high school language teacher and avid user of RS. ( I took over 300 sessions last year) I am asked constantly if I would recommend it. I have gotten many people to use RS. I feel guilty now because I always told them how it was set apart from the other programs because of the live sessions and now I feel like I really led them astray .####$$##%NEGATIVE
Total £379.00  too expensive for me, thank you. check offer SuperMemo, greet####$$##%NEGATIVE
The program I received (as a gift) was in the box and fully wrapped in plastic, the same as it would be from any "authorized" retailer; if you can't simply tell me how to fix a flaw in YOUR software, then your customer service is as terrible as your software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Simy! You're wonderful :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks! I really enjoyed it... Must be hard work for you when you not get one student!####$$##%POSITIVE
Judy, You didn't lead them astray....RS did by their secretive and misleading business practices.  Implementing changes to the core of their language learning program with little to no communication to current and future customers can only be seen as a harbinger of things to come. Just look at the number of complaints here of their FB site. It's become the default customer service portal. Not exactly what any business would envision as a successful social media marketing campaign.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree strongly with both of the above posts. In the past, there were all sorts of "enhancements" - Rosetta Compass, personalized certificates to mark unit completions, and of course, the opportunity to participate in unlimited Studio sessions. In its present state, I would not recommend Rosetta stone to anyone wanting to learn another language. The lame excuse that the sessions were limited because the learners did not value them makes no sense at all. The last webinar I attended ignored all of these issues and stuck with the new party line. To date, I still have no idea of the structure of the new private sessions or how they differ from the current Studio set up. If these issues aren't resolved, I won't be renewing my on line services. I will miss the studio coaches and fellow learners and will investigate alternatives to keep up my newly acquired language skills.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Tom Adams is the Chairman of the Board now.  The CEO is Steve Swad, and he is the former CFO.  As the company is not in a profitable state, I doubt that they are going to lower the price.

Don't be fooled by the huge discounts that RS has been offering off of last year's prices. The native speaker studio sessions have been severely reduced as many posters have noted. You''ll also need to pay extra for an online subscription to access Rosetta World and use the RS tablet / phone apps.  Be sure you have a thorough understanding what you are buying and what the ongoing costs will be before you make a decision to purchase. Get everything in writing!  If you really want to learn a new language there are other options.  Before investing a lot of money into language learning, I always recommend to people wanting to learn a new language that they start out with a small, basic program to get a feel for how much effort is required to learn a language. An internet search will give you an idea of what's out there. Experiment to determine your learning style.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would have to say, before the recent changes, I never thought Rosetta Stone was expensive and I thought you got an incredible bang for your buck. You should investigate how much it is to learn a language in other venues= college courses, Berlitz, private tutors. etc. It was not at all expensive for what you got and I get tired of hearing that complaint from people who really don't know what they are talking about. However now without the 50 minute unlimited sessions or even the 25 minute unlimited sessions and just two 25 minute sessions a month I am not sure that I don't agree that it is expensive. I wouldn't buy a new course from them now, although I have studied 3 languages with them but maybe not because of the price but more because it does not lend itself anymore to conversational and communicative skills which is why I study languages.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why don't you limit individuals who live overseas or your institutional products?  I understand that you are losing money, but it would make sense to limit them as well - or are you more concerned with the backlash from them than from US customers?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I am shocked to find out that it is only the people in the USA who have an individual program  who have been limited to the 2 sessions a month.  We pay the same money for the program as those abroad, don't we? Is this something punitive for us for some reason. Very odd way to do business.####$$##%NEGATIVE
When RS made the changes, they told us about the more frequent studios - one after lesson 2 and one after lesson 4- and they told us that the studios were 25 minutes in length.  They neglected to tell us, however, that we would be limited to 2 sessions per month and that cancellation within a 24-hour period (from the scheduled studio) would result in punitive measures - you lose one of the studios for that month.  As people have been complaining since they found out - through use - you would think that they would have quickly come up with a solution, such as purchasing more studios, or limiting the studios to two per type (two after lesson 2 of a unit and 2 after lesson 4 of a unit). They cannot be advocates of conversational fluency when they have reduced exactly what gets you to that point! In that case,  they need different advertising.  Granted, Swad did say that the limit to two per type would be too heavy of an administrative burden for the company. In that case,  find another solution so that people who have used your product and would like to continue to use it are not treated like second-class citizens.  Obviously, the institutional and international customers are more important because they do not have any limitations with the studios.  RS needs to get a firm policy across the board and not penalize US customers.  This is a very bad customer relations move.  RS  needs to do something productive about it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sweet and thanks for the link####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your response. I have addressed my concerns on these Facebook pages as well as with Nilofer Saidi and Steve Swad. The page is for those who have ideas about making the RS product better for individual language learners. We also share experiences and "trouble-shoot". I can give you an update as to what the issues are, if you are interested, but the free exchange is very important for productivity. Those involved do not want their thoughts, opinions, and comments scrutinized or criticized by RS, thereby, hindering any progress. Unfortunately, at this point, I don't think that opening a dialogue with you would be as productive as we would like. Again, I do thank you for your response and interest.####$$##%NEGATIVE
There is not much teaching anymore. Make sure you find out about their new studio policy. Now you are basically on your own without the help of the unlimited studios. They already have been cut to 25 minutes from 50minutes. A lot of the good feedback you heard about the program is not true anymore. Get more information as it seems you are under the illusion that it is still the same program that it was. It is not.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I finished all 5 levels of German.  It was a great way to improve my confidence in speaking after having 8 semesters of German at the university.  If you are starting a language from scratch, please note that RS does not teach grammar.  They may state that they do, but it is not apparent as it would be in a college course.  I started Polish, but realized that I needed explanations and grammar rules to get going.  I admit that I don't like translations, but being in a college class does not mean that you only get translations.  I had a class in Russian and began to understand the grammar.  I had to return Russian from Rosetta Stone because you are supposed to just "get it".  It is NOT like learning your first language because when you learn your first language, there is constant interaction with people who correct you and you learn through that interaction.  No one truly becomes fluent in a college classroom or through an online language course.  The only way to get true fluency is to live the language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, and I also am getting a certificate in Business German from the local university.  The only thing that is stopping me is the English requirement.  They want to ensure that I speak English!! I told the dean that the requirement is ludicrous.  Also, every week, I speak with friends and relatives in Germany over SKYPE. I belong to organizations in my town that promote German language and culture.   I am still a long way from where I want to be in German, but RS did give me confidence to speak more.  Now, that was with the unlimited studio sessions.  Now that they are limiting them, I have to find another product that will help with future language studies.  I am a language junkie!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
@ Ann, I finished Portuguese but am still taking the live classes as I signed up for them before the change, I finished French but also will take the live classes for the next year as I had already signed up before the change and I am currently studying Italian. I don't think I will be able to renew my program because of the changes which affect renewals I believe, on the online subscriptions, and I would never pay for studios of 25 minutes twice a month. That would be without any value to me so since I am sure I will not finish the 5 levels by July, I will look elsewhere for a program where I can practice my speaking. Sad but true.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks :) I will####$$##%POSITIVE
Barbara - 2 points.  1) After you subscribe, you have the ability to turn off automatic monthly renewal.  Right now, the Rosetta Studio, which is very valuable, has been changed so you can only use it twice per month (two 25 minutes sessions).  This limit was not imposed until recently - hoping to get them to remove the limit.####$$##%NEGATIVE
From what I've been reading in the comments, RS is kind of shooting themselves in the foot lately.  They have taken away something called Studio from being unlimited time to 2 25 minute sessions per month.  If I understand it correctly, it's time with a native speaker.  I can see where unlimited time would be valuable, but I understand those people have to be paid.  I think they should change it so that it's 1 session per unit per level.  So if there were 20 units in level 1, you would get 20 sessions.  But that is just my opinion.  Someone else suggested that they could have a pay as you go for studio sessions.  Maybe that is the way to go.  *shrug*.  I'm just excited to get my software tomorrow or Wednesday.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I had unlimited studios for my German studies and it helped me immensely.  I have relatives in German, and even though they speak English, their kids don't.  I had a lot more confidence because I had the controlled practice.  I have suggested, including to the CEO, that they offer 2 sessions per "level" meaning 4 maximum per unit - two after lesson 2 and two after lesson 4.  They would "unlock" like the stories.  I got the feeling that he didn't want to do that much work.  The studios are what gives the online portion the most value.  Also, studios were 50 minutes long, now they are only 25.  Also, tech support can be "iffy".  It is a good product, but the lack of communication to customers and the lack of organization can be difficult.  Enjoy learning your new language!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with Laura - limitation of two sessions per month makes Rosetta Studio not of much value.  When it was unlimited it was great!####$$##%NEGATIVE
James: $0 man. Like the product very much.  Kip: French. Running the Paris Marathon in April and want to be able to ask directions... Laura and John: I'm using the games as well and though not as effective as the Studio, helpful. When you get a partner. Didn't know about the restrictions. Still new.####$$##%POSITIVE
Is rosetta stone just a gray screen that is empty and keeps shutting off? because that is all i got at the moment. this is not what i paid all that money for. Still frustrated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
no, a grey screen is appearing when I open the software, meaning- I only see the grey background of the software and nothing else but the help icons in the upper right corner. this is after I have installed the language levels, and activated them. I tried to fix it yesterday with help from your chatting helpers (for 2 hours) and we haven't reached any result. still grey background.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Super Bubble Mania is a good tool to learn (or at least get used to) the pronunciation of specific syllables - by listening.  What I am still missing for Portuguese is the game "prosperro" where you can practice grammar - esp. conjugations. By the way: 30000 is the final High Score for Super Bubble Mania. Don't try to get higher. The game ends there, even when you still have some time (seconds at most) left!####$$##%POSITIVE

I have to admit that the technique the software uses is really good, but the software itself is messed up.  It crashes amongst other things.

Join the club!  People have been telling them this since they started the change in October.  They have been ignoring it - or at least not communicating about it.  Did you know that only US individual customers have the limit?  If you are overseas or an institutional customer, you still get unlimited studios.  Why are US customers getting punished??####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS management has changed priorities. ... Stockholders then customers.  The unannounced changes were a well planned out business strategy as evidenced by how well prepared the customer services representatives were trained to follow the customer complaint scripts. They are just riding out the small storm in the US consumer market right now. If you look at the RS reviews on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, etc you will see a definite downturn in ratings starting in mid-October when apparently RS decided that their reputation as the leading language training program was no longer a top priority.   There are plenty of other excellent options for learning a new language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, they may ride out the small storm in the US, but I predict that their sales will drop when people realize that they are not getting value for their money.  I find it insulting that they just made the changes - they emphasized what they deemed were the positives and downplayed the negatives.  Now, they just think that people will eventually go away.  Well, yes, we are but with our money!! I have recommended RS in the past but never will again.  In fact, when people ask why, I will detail the issues that have made it an unwise investment, including but not limited to the lack of interest in customers .  No matter what they say, when they heard that customers were unhappy and walking away from their product, they should have responded.  The government responds more quickly than they do! " Word of mouth" can really damage a company's reputation and they cannot figure that out. Hopefully, all those institutional contracts that the CEO plans to get will fill the void for them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yup! They think consumers are just a bunch of dump clucks that will somehow believe that less is far better if we just tell people that enough times.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have called and called. Maybe the more complaints will help.....####$$##%NEGATIVE
But what is the reason that RS put the studio session limit of only 2x a month?####$$##%NEGATIVE
The reason that the studios are two per month is because the CEO doesn't believe that we, Americans, saw any value in the unlimited studios.  He told me that.  I don't think that he did any research or polls to determine that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree May, it sounds like a total con, we've already paid for our CD's, now we can't use them unless we pay more money, ALL Facebook users should protest to Rosetta Stone!####$$##%NEGATIVE
also cut session time and now allow only 2 session per month!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
The service was great. Friendly and helpful.####$$##%POSITIVE
The best way to connect with the world is to learn the language of others so we can truly speak to and gain understanding off each other I named my daughter Rosata in honor of the Rosetta stone .  I am grateful this program follows the precepts of the orginal to help engineer understanding and knowledge.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree with RS when they say that you should read their "real customer" reviews.  Look, not only on the RS site, but also on the sites of their authorized dealers, such as Best Buy, Amazon.com, and Barnes and Noble.  Get a good feeling for the ins and outs of the software before you invest your money into it.  If, after you do your research, the product is what you want, then by all means purchase it.  You will also need a good grammar book and a German-English/English-German dictionary.  RS does not teach the grammar that most adults need to learn a language and it does not give the English equivalents to words.  Also, I think that I stated above that I am a "real customer" in that I completed 5 levels of RS German.  I also have other languages with them, but found that I needed more explanations and someone to answer questions.  You don't get that in RS.  Also, I loved the German RS because my basic goal was to get more conversationally fluent in the language.  After 8 semesters of university German, I didn't have the confidence.  The unlimited studios really helped me overcome that obstacle.  The studios are only 2 studios a month now, so the actual value of the program (for me) has diminished.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, there is a short article on the financial state of RS and the CEO's plans for the future in the Economist.  In short, they are operating at a loss.  Also, the CEO is cutting back on the kiosks that sell RS to the public.  Most are in large malls and airports.  Personally, I have mixed views on that.  The kiosk is a great way for random people to learn about the product.  MY limited experience with them was overall positive, but I found the staff lacking in RS corporate knowledge and language learning techniques.  The CEO wants to focus more on institutional learners.  Large contracts would bring in more money than our measly several hundred dollars.  I am sure that there will be more cuts to the individual US learners market.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have to say that it doesn't seem to matter whether one complains or not.  The canned responses or lack of response is a sad commentary on the current state of your customer service.  People have been voicing their complaints about the change to studios in the individual US market since the change on October 14.  We have not heard anything to appease our concerns nor has the company communicated any effort on its part to remedy the situation.  Your product's value has diminished for me as acquiring conversational fluency in a language is the most important feature of learning a language.  One cannot do it without oral practice.  The studios are an excellent way to practice what you have learned before trying it out in less controlled situations. Private sessions should be an option, but many of us are not willing to pay more when we have just purchased your product for hundreds of dollars.  Also, the lack of information on the private sessions should give anyone pause - do we get the same coach each time? Is it just a one-on-one studio or are their added benefits for the price?  Are there limits on how many you can take in a 30-day period?  You just started offering these without conveying any detailed information. You need more targeted marketing and more open and honest communication with customers.  Also, when your staff posts as Rosetta Stone, watch your wording and how you communicate with customers and potential customers.  It does reflect on your entire company.  Someone is really "dropping the ball" and that really needs to be addressed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Is this true ROSETTA STONE that you have to pay extra to have World or use of the program  on a tablet on an online subscription???? Where are all of these changes being presented on your web-site.  I feel terrible because I have recommended the product and friends have just bought it and I feel responsible for misleading them because I am kept ignorant of these changes. If you want to make changes do it in the LARGE PRINT, not the small print or no print at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I didn't know that either.  I have only used the program on the computer.  I wouldn't use the app if I had to pay even more. Wow- that is really "nickel and dime -ing" people.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Now, they are offering 3 months online and 6 months online.  They need to settle on a price for the CDs and for one-year of online and stick with it.  Market the advantages of their product rather than constantly having weird sales.  Businesses like theirs (with highly non-essential products) that  have constant sales devalue their product.  Also, a 3 month online subscription? Really? Most people would not finish a course in three months, so it seems like a "bait and switch" -type deal in that they get the deal for the three months, and then if they want to finish end up paying a lot more per month to do so.  There needs to be a better business plan that addresses marketing, customer needs/wants, as well as the financial end.####$$##%NEGATIVE

They should before too long. I applied for every currently updated version of Rosetta Stone for free online and didn't get it, my dad got The Rosetta Stone Latin American Spanish version 2 for free cuz Chick-Fil-A paid for it and there's very few lessons on this program that my Aunt Claris who's a tour guide gave my called 51 Languages Of The World which includes both Latin American Spanish as well as Basque and Catalan which are the 2 primary dilects of Castillion Spanish which is spoken widely throughout Spain and it has this typing program called Unitype which lets you type in over 100 different languages, haven't figured it out yet, every language including Indigenous Languages and excluding Latin and every other dead language out there, is highly important to me and the more languages you're fluent in the better you are in life.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thanks, everyone!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Call and complain and call and call! maybe something will change. It will or I will ..... 2 sessions a month are of very very little use to me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Judy is right - 2 sessions per month is pretty much the same value as no sessions.  RS should listen to their customers and rescind the 2 studio sessions per month limit.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Couldn't agree more. Something needs to change, and fast! I'm just about done with RS. Ready to jump ship...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well, I'm done.  Spanish was my first and last RS course.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Unless RS makes some changes that are satisfactory to the consumer, RS will lose loyal customers and those customers will ensure that others know of their dissatisfaction.  I have several suggestions:           1) I stated that people can have 4 sessions a unit - two after lesson 2 and 2 after lesson 4.  These studios unlock as the person progresses through the program.   2) Give people 6 or 8 studios a month with the option of purchasing more, at a reasonable rate, if they desire.   3) Make the private studios by request only.  There could be a button that people push if they want the private studios.  It would take them to a screen that outlines what the private studios are, what to expect, and then the screen would ask if they want to continue.  Private studios should offer more than just one-on-one, especially since people are paying more.  There should also be that "personal touch" - the same coach for each session ensures that and helps maintain continuity.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I told you that with my friend they gave her 1 after each 2 lessons and then locked it but that isn't worth much to me. I like the idea of being able to buy more sessions but for a reasonable price. Like unlimited for $ 20 a month like you were told about the online subscription. I just don't think their private lessons are worth it but that is something each person can decide for himself. Why would having the button make it better?####$$##%NEGATIVE
But Laura, I was told if you don't let it lapse , you will be able to continue with unlimited live classes. I will want it in writing because the agent told me first that I could and then that she thought I could. I won't renew if I don't get unlimited session. For goodness sake they are only 25 minutes now, that is bad enough.  I think that they have to be very open about what they are doing. By the fault of omission they are still using bad advertising practices that have mislead a lot of people to buy that now realize it was a mistake.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Personally, I don't like seeing the extra charge for private lessons.  It makes the actual cost seem prohibitive.  The button would allow people to get some information about what to expect from the private studios and give them the option of not continuing if they do not like what they see.  Just offering private studios without any fanfare or explanation of what you are getting is a poor marketing strategy.  You have to make it seem that it is better than sliced bread!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry, I left out some words. The prices are $40 for 25 minutes so $80 for 50 minutes or if you fork out $240 in advance $20 for 25 minutes, thus $40 for 50 minutes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Their prices for private sessions are ridiculous.  Really, it's not that difficult to find highly educated native speakers for less money.  RS must be looking in all the wrong places.....surely they're not looking in countries where the language is spoken.  There are quite a few online learning platforms RS could incorporate into to their online platform.  Hooking up learners with native speakers is a piece of cake.   If I'm going to pay for a private lesson, I don't want the native speaking teacher to restrict our conversation to a script. Based on my experience in teaching English to speakers of other languages, students tend to retain what they learn if it's taught in the context of their lives.  If a student is learning, say food vocabulary, well I use their food vocabulary, what they eat, what they would order in a restaurant, etc.  It's all about setting up real life scenarios and working the vocab and grammar into the lessons at a level that's appropriate for the student.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I believe that the reduction to 2 studios a month is not just for the US market, but also for the Canadian market.  So, it is for the entire North American market.  I don't know if this applies to the Central American market.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My problem is I don NOT live in the US.  I live in Japan - learning Japanese.  My best time zone is Eastern - but we are 1/2 a day apart, so unless it is on the weekend - it makes it very difficult.####$$##%NEGATIVE
What exactly are the private studios? Do you get something different than the regular group studios, i.e. more bang for your buck?  I saw that they were $40 for one, $180 for 6 and $240 for 12 and they are less than 30 minutes.  That is a lot of money for people after they have already shelled out $300 or more for your product.  The price might be reasonable for the people who live on the East Coast or in larger cities, but it can be prohibitive for others.  I believe that the private sessions should be by request, not in place of the group studios.  Yes, you can do a studio after lesson 2, but you can only do two a month which means that for a 3 level program, it can take 12 months to do a studio at the point where you can (2 studios a unit is one month).  4 months for one level at 4 units per level!  How is that "more frequent"?  I saw a post from RS that there were going to be changes. I certainly hope that something is done that is mutually satisfactory or RS is really going to lose more $$.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes Private sessions are VERY expensive.  It is extremly sad that you now have to pay sooo much for something that use to be included and unlimited and an hour long. I can understand haveing them 30 minutes long but to cut it down to 2 a month, how is that more frequent than unlimited?.....I would love to see Rosetta's research that says they have improved their course by only haveing to speak 1 hour a month!!!!  And I am not sure what kind of research Rosetta stone does but I know that all other Linguistic research shows that the more time you are abble to speak the more you learn...and it is good to talk to other learners but they are also learning so there is no point in continually making mistakes and no one able to correct you. I do know that I am not the only one dissappointed with this.  I purchaced this product because of the great opprotunity to practice without haveing to spend a lot of money but it seems Rosetta stone has decided to also milk the money for speaking practice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
$80 for a 50 min. private session?  Am I understanding that correctly?    "experience Rosetta Stone in a more focused way''?  What does that mean? If I'm paying $80 for 50 minutes I sure and heck don't want to be revisiting the same pictures I just went thru.  I want to learn how to carry on a spontaneous conversation with someone not regurgitate picture captions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
One private studio is $40.  If you purchase them in blocks, they are $180 for 6 or $240 for 12.  Where I currently live, I can get a private tutor for an hour for less than that.  They really need to do "something extra" for the additional cost - other than a one-on-one.  That does not ensure that you will learn the language better.  If you purchase the 5-level set for $499 plus tax and shipping (if you pay it), and then invest in the private studios, it would be 48 studios and an additional $480.  You can get a college course for less than that, and make contacts to speak the language for less than that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They really have to do something to change the current policy. I think Swad made it clear that he is not interested in individual learners business. Let him stick with the corporate business then that makes him so much money. Just let us know in advance that we have been cut down to nothing for the same money as others pay. Then we can tell others not to buy the program and return what we have. Without studios, we have lost a major component of the program. Maybe if he took a RS  course ,  or spoke another language, he would have an idea of the loss we are feeling. I want to go on to new languages and am already studying 3 but what motivation do I have. I started with 50 minute studios which were soooooo great. I hate the 25 minutes, especially if you are on with 3 other people. Now only 2 a month. Come on, give me a break if you want my business for new courses. Obviously you could care less about us , especially in US and I guess Canada.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I get a message that says that there isn't any Internet connection####$$##%NEGATIVE
I totally agree. Rosetta Stone encourages you to take a Studio Session after finishing Lessons 2 and 4 in each unit, but you can only take two Studio Sessions a month. It seems like Rosetta Stone is saying only finish one Unit a month. At that rate, it would take 20 months to finish the course. Ridiculous! We should be allowed a Studio Session after each two lessons, whether that takes the learner a day, a week or a month.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree.  They made the change without any type of research. I have to say that of all the online resources that they provide, the studios hold the most value.  I can get games in the language on different websites without paying.  I can read on the internet.  I cannot get a structured class based on what I have learned with RS through any other source but RS.  Taking it away devalues RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The change by RS to limit studios to two per month has destroyed the value of Rosetta Studio.  It was  a key part of the learning process.  I hope they listen to their customers and rescind the limit.####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS wants you to spend 20 months to finish a course.  See, they have the consumer right where they want them.  You can either pay for additional private studio sessions at $40 / 25 minutes or you can pay whatever they charge (It's different depending on who, at RS, answers that question) to keep your online subscription active.their goal is to reduce the start-up costs to the consumer by offering their product at low-ball prices.  Once the consumer has taken the bait, they find out that, gee wiz, this learning a new language thing, is####$$##%NEGATIVE
Darn that enter key:)....Their goal is to low ball the customer going in. Once the customer has taken the bait, they find out that, gee wiz, this language learning thing is going to cost me a lot more that I had planned.  Either I pony up for privates and or I keep pumping money into an online subscription.  Why people don't wonder how RS can reduce their prices by hundreds of dollars for the ''same'' product is beyond me. They can because it's NOT the same product.  Simple enough.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I do not know who decided to change the studios from unlimited to 2 per month but it was a "bonehead" move. If you had changed it to, say, 2 a week and made it effective for every individual customer, then it might have been better received.  Also, along with the 8 studios, if you had told people that they could purchase more for a reasonable rate - there would have been grumbling, but I doubt that you would have had the backlash that you have had.  Before you make any more changes that could cost more of your positive goodwill, I think that you need to "get your ducks" in order and get some valid feedback from customers so that you can institute a change that everyone can embrace.  I have had an almost 2-year relationship with you and am willing to give you another chance, but a lot depends on your response.####$$##%NEGATIVE
At a minimum RS should provide one Studio Session after finishing lesson 2 in a unit and another after finishing lesson 4 in a unit. I understand they need to cut costs, but they went WAY WAY overboard by limiting studio sessions to two a month.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good luck! When you do get it to work you are limited to 2 sessions per month. Not a good value!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You're kidding!  2 sessions?......... what a rip off####$$##%NEGATIVE
OK........ so are these sessions the "classes" that I have to schedule, Billy Ray Mainer?  I don't understand any of it.  I'm very annoyed and frustrated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The reason I bought the online version is because I do NOT have a desktop computer...........nor do I have a FUNCTIONING printer............. so I call for help and they tell me they sent the instructions to my email......... except they're useless because I do NOT have a photographic memory and I have no way of printing out the instructions.   And what's the deal with the "two times a month"......... WHAT is only two times a month?####$$##%NEGATIVE
keep looking........ I'm not on anything and I still find the product USELESS####$$##%NEGATIVE
Does it help to let you know that you are not alone?  I didn't think so.    Two times a month means that you can schedule 2 - 25 minute group studio sessions per month. If you want additional studio sessions you will need to purchase private studio sessions for $40/25 min session. If you forego the private studio sessions, but you want to take the RS recommended studio session after Lesson 2 and Lesson 4, you'll need to renew your online subscription for another 8 months if you have a 5 level course.   Good luck getting your money back. The RS Success team is always so sorry as they are trained to do and they will try to help you. However, the problem lies with the management team of the company who has put their employees in an untenable position.####$$##%NEGATIVE

25 minutes in and nobody wants to play :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
it just bothers me that I was told something would happen, and it didnt.  No follow up or anything.  I've been talking great about the company for months mentioning that I'd ordered a CD, since my whole family has heard those commercials and wondered about it.  I understand it may be hard to believe, but some of us dont have internet connection (like a grandparent or kids computer) and that makes it awful tough, if not impossible (!), to logon to your website. I have internet at this terminal, but not at every computer that wanted to try the program.  It is your incorrect assumption that all your prospective clients have internet access.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thank you Lesie. I appreciate your attention here on FB. However, after waiting more than two days simply for a link to the instant download, I have decided to learn with a different program. I was told this morning by Rosemary at Rosetta Stone Success that my order cannot be cancelled, but can be returned (although I have nothing physical to return). I am expecting a refund "shortly". (ETA: A new e-mail from RS has defined "shortly" as 10 - 14 business days.)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Third time was the charm.  Still miffed about being hung up on twice...especially since we were planning to buy another program this spring.  I have been so disappointed by your customer service time and again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for  your input.  I finally got through to someone in the US this afternoon that was able to help me work through a couple of problems and he gave me some guidance on the others.  I will spend some time working on those later.  It is unfortunate that I have to work so hard just to get the program to do what it is suppose to do.  We'll see how it goes.  Thanks again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm curious as to why Justin's verification code was verified by the Rosetta Stone organization? How the heck is he supposed to know it's a pirated copy if even RS doesn't know?    Your reply seems to put the blame squarely on Justin for not consulting with your anit-piracy team BEFORE he purchased your product. What reputable company treats their customers like this?   The right thing to do is to provide a customer who bought your product in good faith, whose verfication code was validated by RS, who used it for 2 years before hearing even a peep out of RS, is to send him a brand new yellow box of language CDs with your most sincere policy for the error on your part.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree that at least two per week (per language) is a good start.  I was really saddened when I saw that the limit was 2 per month.  And as each session is only 25 minutes, it really doesn't make it worth your while.  I guess that they just don't think that North Americans value the studios.  People in other countries and institutional learners still get unlimited studios.  Hopefully, they will come up with a solution that is mutually satisfactory - and apply it to ALL individual learners, not just those in the US and Canada.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They should at least double the limit to 4 or better yet, make them unlimited again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Many thanks for the response Rosemary, I have replied to the email.####$$##%POSITIVE
Absolutely, Lesie!  That is IT!  I had put off getting the headset, and was using my iPad.  I noticed the lessons are ready for me to keep going on my PC!  Thank you for being so attentive to my panic!  ;)####$$##%POSITIVE

Yeah so far I am not super impressed with this software. Glamorous advertising, poor software. Misdirected resources?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah I would like to say the same, if only I could. Why is there now no live chat, and no one has answered my e-mail as yet from your support department? As a "global company" why is there no support staff working 24/7 to cover customer needs from anywhere round the world?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi, thanks for your response. I have to say I was very happy with your product and customer service up until a few weeks ago. When I initially bought the program and was provided the 3 month free trial, I used the online sessions so many times throughout each month. It really helped reinforce my learning by practicing to speak it out loud. When the free trial ended, I had family come from abroad so I decided to hold off on renewing until I had more time to devote. I recently renewed and no where on the renewal page did it mention the change to a limit of 2 sessions per month. That was the only reason I renewed. I don't use the other online features. Had I known there is now a limit, I would not have renewed. I would like to know if there is any way my account can go back to having the unlimited online sessions access. I have emailed customer service about it about a week ago, but they keep providing me information about the change, without answering my question. Thank you and I hope RS will look into this before refusing my request.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, did you notice that the studios are now only 25 minutes? With three other people in them, it isn't very productive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, I agree! Not sure why RS made these changes. Probably to cut costs...unfortunately at the expense of the consumer, especially that the price of the product has not decreased.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The studios are still unlimited for overseas learners (individuals)  and institutional learners.  If they want to cut costs and keep some "goodwill" then they should have done the research and dropped all individual learners down to 2 a month - not just those in the US and Canada. As a business, you have to be consistent and do the proper research before you change your policies.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was not aware that they made this change only to US and Canada customers. Now I'm even more frustrated! It would be nice if we can get an explanation for their decision to cut back.####$$##%NEGATIVE

i am happy with the service i had from technical support ...i made some changes to my computer and it is working ..Thank you !!!####$$##%POSITIVE
That is a shame, especially for a good customer, Karen.Righ t now I am ok because I have ongoing live studios that I paid for before the change.However, I did recommend the program to 2 people who bought it before I knew about the change and  I felt terrible because I was raving about the unlimited studios we get. There is a disconnect between their advertising and the reality for the North Americans. Since the unlimited is still true for most of the world, I think they need to have an alert that pops up for the North American market before you renew or buy  that tells you that you will be limited to 2/25 minute sessions a month. Then you can decide with full knowledge what you want to do.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Whether you appreciate my comments and assessment or not, the big issue is why a customer service department would delete a cutomer's email without even reading it! And take 30 days to decide NOT to read it!  I would think customer service is at the heart of your business.  Thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
David- I generally think the CD set is a good product.  I bought mine (French) before they had the online component, and then added Italian a few years later.  I did like the online component when they added it later- there are games that are good practice for a change, and I especially liked the at the time "unlimited" studio sessions, where you could practice what you are learning with a native speaker.  My primary complaint is with the way that they have back on the studio sessions without notice to the customer.  I have also had alot of technical problems with the online sessions, especially recently, and it is sometimes difficult to get on the schedule at a specific time.  All this being said, I think the CD set is good as a stand alone investment.  You can try the online component (I think you get a free trial period with the CD's) and then decide if that piece is worth continuing to pay for.  And of course I am really annoyed at customer service right now, for the reasons stated above.  Good luck!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Boo, Rosetta Stone!####$$##%NEGATIVE
The funny thing is you've just saved me a bunch o' bucks because I need to get up to speed w/ my medical Spanish. I have books, I needed the one on one sessions. Whew! Thanks!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes - if you want "tallk time" RS is no longer the product to buy - especially if you are in North America.  I just did a 25 minute studio with 3 other people, and you really don't get much of an opportunity to talk.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, I always feel so let down at the end of the 25 minute studios and when they are with 3 others, you really only get a few minutes to talk . If I am on a high level with 3 others who are struggling I could scream. I have been lucky in Italian. I am usually on with just one other person. Last night I was on with 2 others but they were very good and so was the coach.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I have to comment that I had a few problems when going through the German program and, now, with the Portuguese one.  Some of my answers were considered incorrect because I really could not tell the difference between a female and a male.  If there really are issues with the Spanish (LA) program, you need to give them the Level, Unit, and Lesson as well as the screen numbers.  The issues are not corrected immediately, but are included with updates (when they have them).####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you both. Very helpful information.####$$##%POSITIVE
You go online for either. It depends how quickly he learns. The online version is cheaper but ends in one year. All live studios are included for one year, although you need to know they are limited 2 2 a month now. With the discs, you have them forever and don't have to worry about not finishing the program in time. You get the 2 live studios for 3 months with the discs and then you have to renew the studio part of the subscription which is not expensive. If you are writing from another country than the US or Canada you get unlimited sessions. So it all depends on how long you think it would take him to finish all 5 levels if those languages have 5 levels. You can also renew the online subscription but it is a little more expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You may own the license to use ''forever'', but, and this is a BIG but, with the rapid changes in hardware, server and operating system technology, your ''forever'' program may not, probably will not, work should you decide to upgrade your OS to say Windows 8 or buy a new computer with a different operating system. You also will not be able to take advantage of any software upgrades and improvements that RS makes to their product without paying an upgrade fee. The ''own it forever'' is a crock! You don't actually own the software only a license, which is licensed to you only, to use the software.   Why RS doesn't just go with a subscription based model and be done with the outdated CDs is beyond me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I purchased French and Spanish levels 1-3 and am missing the application disk for the French portion and when I cannot activate them on my Mac.

Natural speech is not forced speech. In a real-life conversation, when you want to ask a question, you already know what you want to ask. You just may not have the words for it yet. As you get more exposure to the language in comprehensible contexts, you learn how to formulate these questions and inquire about what you want to know. In real conversations, you are not expected to read someone's written-out answer to your yet-unformed question, for example, and then guess at what the question might be, making sure that it matches word-for-word. That is Jeopardy, not normal communication.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is not to mention that there is research, of which I'm sure Rosetta Stone is already aware, which shows that forced speech does not aid in language acquisition, and can even hinder it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I usually skip the Milestone lessons exactly for the reasons Ben has outlined. There could be a half dozen or more responses which could be correct. We're not mind readers or, in this case, picture interpreters.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I kept failing them and taking them many times. There is a button for answers so you can see what they want . I think it is helpful and not cheating yourself. With milestone you are right, not enough time to figure out what they want. I think it is a little button in the left hand corner at the bottom with a green dot of something. It works on all of the lessons except the reviews. Sometimes the pictures are hard to figure out and I look at the answers if I am not sure. Also when a new concept is being introduced it is helpful  to look at the answers and think about what it is they are teaching. Also there is a pdf of everything it each level that might be helpful. It is the whole course contents.  I make a summary of important points and study them to be prepared for the live sessions. You can find those on Rosetta Stone Course contents and download each level.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Judy,  True, but the course should be set up to where you don't have to do any of that. Plain and simple: they just need to redesign some things.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Now, this kinda scares me to put the money into it and have that problem and no help?????????####$$##%NEGATIVE
Unfortunately, I have read on this page that some people who have older versions do not get support and the new OS systems do not always support those versions.  I don't know about you, but I don't have the same computers that I had 5 years ago - we always upgrade.  Maybe, they need to do what some gaming companies do in that you get the program online, but get a backup disc in case you have problems.  Most software has a limited life. My mother has software from several years ago and cannot load it on her new computer.  As far as RS is concerned, I finished German, but admit that I have not gone back to look at the program.  I moved forward with the language.  I have the PDF of the course and glance at that from time to time (and I have the audio companion on CD), but I don't want to keep going back to the course.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Ben You can keep it forever and when it no longer runs on your computer, I hear that the CDs make very trendy coasters.  Subscription ensures that you have the latest version of the language learning program at all times. RS does make improvements to it's programs from time to time and, unless you're willing to shell out money for an upgrade, you're kind of stuck.  You'll also be charged about $25 for each support call if you want RS to help you out when RS won't run on your brand new computer.  But, hey, if you've got bucks to waste, good for you! I don't!o each his own, but the advances in educational technology are passing you right by. It is practically impossible to become conversationally fluent in a language without a lot of live interaction with a native speaker.  If you're just going to read what's on the screen you may as well just buy a book or two for a lot less money.  No online subscription; no studio, no games, no chat, no nothing.  Crap sounds so much nicer in Spanish = mierda ... or French merde ..... or Hindi मल:)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think that they are increasing the studios to 4 a month. It is still a big decrease from unlimited.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well, that's *better* but yeah... I'd gladly pay a bit more for unlimited if it was some cost issue for RS.  But I'm more upset the renew page said "unlimited online access" and apparently only meant that as games and such, not sessions.  That's quite deceptive. (Like when they said "enhancements to our online sessions"  meant cutting them down to 25 minutes, and actually cutting the available number of lessons in half.)  Still, any time I did a new session for the first time,  I never would do well. It took a few times to really get the hang of it. Now, I'd have to wait months to get that ability with RS alone?####$$##%NEGATIVE
It posted before I was finished (sorry for long posts.)   So, now I'm apprehensive to even do my sessions since they're so limited.   Even with four,  I couldn't go back and refresh my skills.  Again, this was my absolute favorite part of the program, and what set RS apart I thought.  **sigh** Watashi wa totemo kanashii desu.  :-(####$$##%NEGATIVE
UGHHH!!! That is a ripoff!!! And ONLY 25 MINUTES!!??? THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TIME.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is interesting that people overseas (not in the US and Canada) get unlimited studios as do institutional learners.  It is just the North American market that has these limitations. I believe that, if they are going to limit individuals learners in the US, they should limit all individual learners.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is a shame and you are completely right. It is especially maddening because these studios cuts are just to North Americans. The new learners in other countries have unlimited access for the same money we pay. The lack of informing the customer and leading them to believe they will get all the sessions they want (look at the video about the studio) is unconscionable to me. I am loosing respect for a company I used to love. I am really shocked at the unscrupulous way they are getting people to buy. If they want to make these changes to the American market, they need to be up front and honest about it. owe up to their marketing plan, not misguide people in order to get their money. People are losing respect for them left and right. All of these sales over lapping, also would make one wonder about a company so unorganized. What happened to the RS that I loved so???####$$##%NEGATIVE
RS is a perfect example of why people really need to do their research before buying any product that costs several hundred dollars BEFORE they buy. As I've posted many times of this FB page, what disturbs me the most about RS is not that they have cut back on the live sessions, for what I assume are cost cutting measures, but that RS management has made a strategic decision to deliberately mislead consumers.  Advertising their product at half the price, or less, than last year is deliberately misleading. Unlimited studios to 2 - 25 minute studios a month is a major change in their product since last year. It is not the same product and they know it! The product is far less effect in getting a student to any level of conversational fluency with almost no interaction with a native speaker.   How they get away with it is a mystery to me. Really, it's a shame that a once highly respected company like Rosetta Stone would damage their reputation with such strategic tactics.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Show me where I can opt out of ads completely.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It works very well, I'm still on the first disk and already thinking in spanish lol####$$##%POSITIVE
I have learned through RS to have  a conversation with native speakers. Fluent? Can't expect that for many years using every possible way to use the language on your own. You have to have a burning desire to become "fluent" in a language no matter what course you take. You have to use it and read it and watch it on tv and meet with people, and find Skype friends in other countries to practice with or live awhile in the country which uses your language of interest. I think it is a life time effort on your part. RS is a "stone" in your language learning path. I am happy I still have the old way of unlimited sessions,even though they have been cut to 25 minutes. However with the new rules of a few a month, I would never be where I am today. So yes it is helpful and there is something to be said for the natural way of learning for a start. But the changes that are being made are questionable to how much the company actually wants us to succeed and what their real goals are for our language learning. If you don't live in North America you will get more benefits from the program as it has only been cut in North America to make up for their losses.If you don't live here , I highly recommend the program. Also remember that the "real" customer reviews are based on the old RS offerings and got different results than what you will get now. This cutting of studios is very new and you need to wait to hear what new people from  North America are saying when they actually finish the program under the new guidelines. I for one am most interested in knowing what their progress will be with so few live interactions provided with a native speaker.To be an honest company, they should lower our prices since we are getting less or stop offering it altogether in North America. The should be a company that stands up to their actions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
By the "real" customers do you mean the ones that won't say anything critical?####$$##%NEGATIVE
@RS - you really need to fix that canned response regarding "real" customers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It depends on what you mean by ''learn''. If you want to learn lots of vocabulary and pronunciation, yes, RS works quite well.  If you mean ''can I have a fluent conversation with a native Spanish speaker, then no, RS will not take you to that level. In my opinion, the only way to build fluent conversation skills is by practicing with a native speaker....a lot! You are only allocated 2 - 25 minute studio sessions a month. With up to 3 additional learners in your studio session, you can see that you'll only get a few minutes of practice twice a month. Private sessions are available but they are expensive. Please be aware that if you purchase the CD set you will only have 3 mos. of online access. If you wish to continue your online access, including the mobile apps, you need to purchase a monthly subscription.   Grammar instruction is non-existent. You'll need to buy supplemental workbooks or you won't understand the nuances of the Spanish language. The subjunctive is particularly challenging for English speakesr as the subjunctive is seldom used in English.   I have an online subscription which I use mostly for supplemental practice. The course has lots of materials to work thru which I really like. The solo games are OK but there are only a half dozen or so. In 6 weeks, the program has not been able to find a match for me to play a game with. Seems like that would be fun, but there's no one to play with! Chat is useless.  For other reviews, checkout the reviews on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi your ad says I accepted your offer and I did not accept any offer.  Im dont understand why its saying that to my friends?  Even if its advertising ....its false advertising, can you explain.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks i did.  In there it doesnt expain why you advertise to my friends that  I accepted a offer I never accepted. ??? I actually own Rossetta stone from a purchase i made years ago.  I like it.  I dont appriciate you guys advertising I accepted a offer to my friends that I NEVER accepted? I still do not understand this?  You say to my friends i accepted a offer of 30% off.  No i did not, at least can you keep it real?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I should not have to.  I never interacted with this claim.  ??  You are welcome to not make claims that are not true, even if facebook lets you.  Anyway enough said.  Ill change my settings.  Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE

Ok thank you for responding. I really appreciate it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for the response, but I just don't buy it.  I shouldn't have to take any action to preclude your intrusive posts.  Frankly, in this day of pinpoint marketing, I'm surprised that you would would jeopardize your brand in this way.  Some social media maven needs their knuckles wrapped.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cheryl...I'm well aware of Facebook's ad feeds and I do find their intrusiveness aggravating.  I'm just trying to make my views known to those organizations affiliated with the ads, which is a big part of what social media is about.####$$##%NEGATIVE

It's on your page because of advertising now. Every 3-4 posts is an ad now. It makes me angry, but what can we do...FB is free. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Cheryl Holden wants us all to enjoy crappy advertising! She also wants us to enjoy the burden of removing every single advertiser from our newsfeed instead of placing the responsibility with an advertiser to listen to those who voice their discontent and remove them from their ads from that persons newsfeed! Like getting calls all throughout the day from harassing businesses? GREAT! So does Cherly! That's fine but for those is us who don't want it and don't like it... STOP SPAMMING MY NEWSFEED!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, Christy. The same issues occur in Safari as well as the iOS app (although less often). I have recently upgraded my internet speeds so that the Studio sessions would work better. I am paying a premium for this service and when I sit down to learn, I expect it work. Instead, I walk away frustrated and deflated. Could it be that your servers get slammed at peak periods? Are you working to improve the experience for the user?####$$##%NEGATIVE
If I could opt out of ads, you wouldn't be reading this. If you don't want to hear from me, don't put your SPAM on my page. "Facebook gets paid to deliver the ad. The owner sends the ad to Facebook and describes who should see it: people who live nearby and like running."####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes!!! Stop giving us ineffective ways to get your crap off our Wall!!! What happened to customer service?! I NEVER "Like(d)" your page!!!! STOP SPAMMING MY NEWSFEED!!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you as a company and the staff member who took the time to respond to me. I highly appreciate that. I also would like to say I love uour product very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone, thank you for listening to your customers! Just got your email about improving the studio subscription.####$$##%POSITIVE
@Irina - is what they proposed enough of a change??####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think it is a good deal. They are increasing studio sessions to 4 per month, that is reasonable, and offer few special deals with automated subscription.####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't know.  Those overseas still get unlimited sessions.  I believe that everyone should be limited, not just those in the US/Canada.  I know that they want a better business model and part of that is being consistent across the board.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They just emailed me my shipping confirmation today... one WEEK after it was actually picked up by UPS and 4 days after I received it! Shambles!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Completely annoying. I've got 'proof of purchase' issues cos we got it through groupon. Gotta love a bargain...####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you so much for your help !!####$$##%POSITIVE
The Rosetta Course app only needs flash because RS chooses not to invest in upgrading the app so it doesn't require flash. As Melody suggest, HTML5 should do the trick.  Today's consumers demand cross platform usage. I have many Spanish learning apps that I write in all the time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I notice that you didn't do YOUR research and read that my wife is Thai you twit. I also know it it is a skit made to parody the Thai people you are the fool for thinking I didn't. Further more I did find the skit about Martin Luther King Jr to be offensive to black people and my friends in the Navy have written in about that already. Pandora was only put back in the box by ignorant Americans like yourself and the Thai people and government are still fighting to have the videos on You Tube removed. You are just another example of how pompous, insensitive, and arrogant the American people are! Congratulations! Pat you self on the back and give yourself a participation award for doing nothing to fix the problem ie. yourself! I also posted on SNL FYI...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well so far I can't even get mine to function! I paid for it 5 days ago and haven't been able to get a response from customer services still as to why the activation code they provided me themselves doesn't work, so the product won't operate at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Mine won't work either and this is the third product I've had to go through like this.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Every time I enter the activation code it tells me that I have a "minor error".  This is apparently from when you all got hacked with the number one entered as the code.  The software seems to be working but I'm not sure I am getting everything because it still won't accept the activation code.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My husband spent 2 hrs on the phone today and finally got it resolved.  But, really, three purchases and three aborted attempts at loading the software....methinks there must be a problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
omg...did Rosetta Stone just imply that everyone who posted here are not "real" customers??????...WOW... I AM SO NOT BUYING THIS PRODUCT!!!!! Thanks everyone for all your responses and posts... and thanks Rosetta Stone for making my decision a piece of cake...####$$##%NEGATIVE
@RS - you really need to change the canned response that talks about "real" customers.  Also, it might be nice to make a statement or apologize to the real customers that have posted in places other than your website.  Thank you for your consideration.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I loved this deal and it came right when I was going to buy it anyway! It was our tax return gift to ourselves. I will learn spanish####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm having the same problem, and as a result can't use the product at all. No help from the online support, they said they can't deal with it and that customer services has to handle it. I am very frustrated and upset considering the cost of the product. I bought it direct from Rosetta Stone, so there is no excuse really why the activation code they themselves provided should cause an 'error'.####$$##%NEGATIVE
De rien Gemma. Hope your access is sorted out soon. By the way, my experience of the US customer services is much better than the UK one (whom I dealt with last week to track down my order... they told me completely wrong information!)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would like to learn spanish but not at that price####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not unless they were sold to us as old versions. They are CDs. We just purchased 2 of the languages 4 years ago####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is exactly why "you own the software forever'' is so misleading. You own the license rights to run the RS software until it no longer runs on your hardware. Then you will have to purchase an upgrade that will run on your computer or ?? With the extremely rapid technology changes we see today, it makes absolutely no sense to spend hundreds of dollars to purchase CDs. If you think that RS is for you, buy an online subscription! As long as you keep paying, you are assured that you are working with the latest version of the software AND you don't have to mess around with messy installations.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's been more than 2 days for me and I still can't get into the lessons... I get a "minor error" message which stops the lessons from loading, and the online support can't help (what's the point in their existence then??) so I have to wait for email from customer services which may take up to 2 days (it's already been 5 days since i first ordered the course). VERY annoying and I will never buy this software again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks guys, for working with me on this.  Very much appreciated and I'm looking forward to learning my new language!####$$##%POSITIVE
I am disappointed that Rosetta Stone continues to end up on my Home Feed when I (and thousands of others) have requested they stop####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am still having issues. It stops in the process of syncing.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I almost wrote the same thing about communications errors being something that existed in the '90's.  Customer support has been very bad.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The dialog box said "A minor error has occurred, number eb042c0cafb5a3005f453f36991acecb7873085e.  Click OK to continue."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm on chat right now.  NOT at all happy to be told that to have spent several hundred dollars on something, I needed to pay more to talk to tech support.  :(  But hopefully we'll get this resolved.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It might be nice if you folks told purchasers they have six months to install the software after purchase, or they'll have to go through all kinds of hoops to use it.  :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much, Christy.  The person in chat with me that night did help me resolve that, and she was very patient.  I was just... stunned at some of the things I was told on the phone: having to pay extra for service, that sort of thing.  The person on chat was very competent and patient though.  :)  Still, it really might be good if people could be warned to activate their software ASAP after purchase.  I waityed so long because Life is complicated--but wow, what a surprise that night.  Thanks for getting back to me.####$$##%POSITIVE
It was a $25 difference. I'm not too happy with my experience so far.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much for the quick reply and speed solution to my issue. I am looking forward to getting started!####$$##%POSITIVE
Lovely lack of apology, by the way. This issue is not resolved until I receive working discs,  which remains to be seen.####$$##%NEGATIVE
yea.... that didn't help. I don't have a "second computer with a working CD drive." Looks like I need to buy an external hard drive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wow. Thank you so much Janice. That was the kind of reply I hoped for and didn't expect to get.   I really appreciate the time you took to reply.####$$##%POSITIVE
Any idea when you will get a fix for this? I don' t always use my own computer, and I do not want to play with those that are not mine.  Thx.####$$##%NEGATIVE
imagine how many more of these they would sell if they worked####$$##%NEGATIVE
Or if they proofread their ads; see my pic above with "love is the univeral language". I have seen the ad multiple times; they must be catering to the uneducated who don't know better - a bit like those email scams.####$$##%NEGATIVE

thanks but ive been sent this already. ive done EVERYTHING your tech support have told me to do and still on day 3 i am getting error 1141 AGAIN.####$$##%NEGATIVE
what im most sick about is that ive spent about 5 hours trying to fix the problem and under 2 hours learning the language... my laptop is about 18 months old so not an old one and i am getting so many issues.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is impossible. Nothing on the link you provide gives a user the possibility of "opting" out of advertising.####$$##%NEGATIVE

See life ain't all bad!next time I want to learn another language I'll buy their product! Good company!####$$##%POSITIVE
Peter Jones I am doing the Russian course:D it's great!####$$##%POSITIVE
I called your company and asked for Afrikaans language. First off the woman did not know what country that language was from and that she had never heard of it. I told her Africa and then I told her to be specific South Africa. (you used to sell this language years ago, wish I had bought it then) Jill then stated that  I could get Swahili because this is the product you sell to people who are wanting to learn an African language or are going to Africa. I told the woman that I did not think that this was correct but I would check with my husband who is from South Africa.  Well Swahili is no where close to the same language as Afrikaans!! WOW!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. I  have managed to fix part of the problem, but the original sync problem still exists on both computers. When in sync process, it just stops.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Shannon, dont worry the studio coach cant see you, only you can see them, thank goodness! I would look a fright at times! The sessions are great for confidence building, i can recommend them :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, Christy.  Actually, your technical support was not helpful.  When I received the replacement discs yesterday, success came after I removed my first language, added the new language, then added the original language again.  I spent 2.5 hours doing this and it was something I figured out entirely on my own.  The new set of discs actually gave me the same error message the first set had so I saw no point in calling tech support again as they really had no viable solutions the first time and in fact, didn't know how to properly transfer a call to customer service.  I don't mean to be ugly.  Things happen but we are talking about $1000 worth of software here and your employee in sales was pretty bad.  "I just work here" is never a proper thing to say to a customer.  Nor is hanging up on them when they have not raised their voice or been inappropriate in any way.  I, myself work in a call center so I know of what I type.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Same situation here  and getting no response from the company.  It is a shame, the company used to be ery responsie to its customers and that is "totally" gone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
If it helps, I tried my course today and found that the microphone did work with the course, despite it still saying that it wouldn't. So perhaps try yours again and see if it works too. I agree about the customer service. Perhaps they are being inundated with enquiries, but it's still no excuse for taking several days to respond to emails.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Viel Dank! I appreciate all this information very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes. That is the same problem I've had. At this point I am already at level 4 and have not had a studio session. I wonder if I will have one before I'm done with the program.  ####$$##%NEGATIVE

Christina, thanks for the support. I never liked their page. However one of my friends did. So my guess is that is where the connection occurred. I did some research and Rosetta Stone has a history of spamming. Back in 2008 and 2009 they had aggressive email campaigns which caused them to be the one of the "do not do this" marketing articles as an example of how to hurt your own brand. They obviously have moved these practices to Facebook.####$$##%NEGATIVE

@sherry porter Young ---- You're information is inaccurate.  Facebook POLICY allows Rosetta to place their advertising on our News Feeds.  And Rosetta is an active participant.  Facebook would not be able to just post it without Rosetta's permission.  Get your facts straight before you try to act condensending about Jackie's post.  "Sounds like you need to learn somehing at least".   Uncalled for.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You are not the only one seriously disappointed in Facebook and Rosetta.  There is no excuse. The news feed and notifications should be STRICTLY for those we actually WILLINGLY added to our friend list. Period. And we should not have to jump through hoops to take/hide them from our news feeds after the fact.####$$##%NEGATIVE
By the way Rosetta, you response gives the impression that we can OPT out of the ads like yours showing up on our news feed.  We cannot.  It does NOT give us any conrol.  All we can do is delete/hide YOUR ads only AFTER they have already shown up on our News Feeds. And THAT is the problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jari, you are not the only one getting this generic response from Rosetta.  Everyone that has complained just gets this 'delete us' response from Rosetta.  There is no excuse.

The suggestion to "opt out" of advertising on my timeline led nowhere. I already have my timeline set so only friends can post there. The ads, NOT from any firm I have liked or befriended, keep cluttering my timeline. So, anything I get in my news feed is subject to my comments in reply, good and bad. I didn't ask to be their friend, and I may not be friendly. Note that I don't mind the regular sponsored paid advertising on FB, on the right side of the page where it should be, not in my news feed. Thanks for your comments, Christina.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Rosetta Stone is great      I do not like unsolicited vendors on my Facebook.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is running but my headset is not working. lol####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have already contacted cust support and have deactivated it.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that your company will not refund the shipping charges.  I would suggest that you either fix your software or disclose that it does not work correctly before you sell it to the customer.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So Lesie how about starting my 30 days online once this is resolved rather than when I called to activate?  That is what is most distrestting abouy this.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you -- it does take a really long time and that's why I thought there was something I should be doing. Clicking or dragging or pressing the return key, cursing in German.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for the quick response. I don't have another mic on my computer (I only plug in my webcam when I need to). Everytime I go into Rosetta Stone it has me set up the mic by counting to five and that works fine. The problem is within the lessons it's cutting me off too early. When I go into the playback window (where it says the phase slowly and then I repeat it back to compare inflection), it often skips my first syllable (yes, I am waiting until it beeps and turns green) and then cuts me off if I pause at all. And that is even when there is a pause in the phrase like when it goes over a sequence of numbers or there are two sentences with a slight pause in between. Maybe getting a new headset will fix the issue but it seems software based. I got Rosetta Stone a few years ago when preping for a trip. Has the software or hardware (mic/headphones) improved since then? Or are there any mic/headphones you recommend? Thanks for your time and attention!####$$##%NEGATIVE
This does NOT help. I was not able to DEACTIVATE the program from my Mac because it died. So it will not allow my to activate it on the new computer. It is installed just not activated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
es el mejor programa para aprender ingles, El ingles es muy facil! I LOVE INGLISH....####$$##%POSITIVE
There now appear to be more studios. Thank you.####$$##%POSITIVE
No but have been told this is the best way to learn. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Rosemary, yes I received the email and my issue was resolved. Thanks for the prompt assistance. Facebook is very effective in resolving my issue####$$##%POSITIVE
It does thank you so much.####$$##%POSITIVE
Spam makes me sick####$$##%NEGATIVE
Avoid Rosetta Stone. I've tried it, and it cannot do what it maintains.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Immersion works best in a total environment, but Rosetta Stone can't provide that. I also suspect that adult learners need more grammar than it can provide (for example, in its woefully inadequate Russian package). At best, it might help with pronunciation -- but there are less expensive ways to manage this. In short, try grammar books, try TV, radio, movies, try discussions with native speakers, and read as much as you can. All of these things are more helpful and much less expensive than Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You must WORK for them!!! Rossetta Stone sucks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I have tried that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much! I will share it with in my language club####$$##%POSITIVE
Will do going to ask my Spanish lecturer on his opinion on your products, still not convienced though.####$$##%NEGATIVE
There are always the private studios.  Personally, I think that they are a terrible idea because you already pay a lot for the program.  Why pay more? When they first offered Totale, they should have made certain restrictions.  Doing them so far into the program is poor customer service and poor management.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's a real shame because the program is great and the studios are a MASSIVE part of its greatness. Change those and it's just not worth it anymore. Like you said it's not cheap to start with. I honestly believe they will lose customers who just won't renew anymore....####$$##%NEGATIVE
They no longer have Danish.  It was version 2 and they are now on version 4.  They did not update the software for that language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ok, thanks Janice...but I wonder why...:(####$$##%NEGATIVE
"opt out of Facebook advertising through your privacy settings" ???, try to find that setting. I've been using computers and programs for over 30 years. I spent the last 15 minutes looking for your suggested setting and cannot find it. Can you be more specific?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your help. After several unsuccessful calls to Rosetta Stone, Facebook support came through. I appreciate your helpful and thoughtful customer service.####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Angeline, I took French through Rosetta Stone a few years age and am now majoring in French at university. Although Rosetta Stone is helpful with vocabulary, it does not have lessons on other important language skills such as verb conjugation, verb tenses, grammar rules etc. It is a good product if you are only planning to use your target language as a tourist: however, if you are hoping to become fluent I would suggest taking another approach to learning your chosen language. I hope you find this helpful, I can't speak for anyone else, this is just my experience.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I think that RS is good to start a language, but you really need supplementary materials - like a good grammar book and a good dictionary.  The program really does not teach grammar.  As you go through, they have sections that they call "grammar", but they just give you simple things and you have to guess what is actually going on.  The program is fun and will get people going to learn a language, but for those who are truly serious, you will need much more than Rosetta Stone to become fluent in a language.  YOu will need to know grammar, you will need to read in the language, and try to get exposed to it every chance that you get.  You need to practice it either face-to-face or over the internet.  You may need to move to a country where the language is spoken.  I agree with both Judy and Dana, with Judy in that you need to learn to communicate.  I took RS for German after 8 semesters of German.  What it did for me was to help with the confidence to speak  Of course that was when they offered unlimited studios at 50 minutes each.  Now, at 4 per month, and barely 25 minutes, you just get enough to get you interested, but not to really get you speaking or conversationally fluent.  I agree with Dana in that you really need to study the language to understand it.  I am now taking Portuguese and Italian with RS, BUT I have either taken courses at the local university or am currently  taking a course.  Unfortunately, I need to know some grammar and ask questions.  I cannot learn a language as I did when I was a child - I don't have constant reinforcement, only time at a computer or in a meetup.  Depending on the language that you want to learn, RS could be a good comprehensive start, but I believe that for serious learners, you need more exposure and reinforcements.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I did a trial of this and was not impressed. They teach you words. I prefer the  Pimsleur Approach which gets you right into speaking common sentences and breaking it up into different words.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is how I'm learning Korean!!  Great program!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Also with Rosetta Stone and using a microphone, I had somewhat of a Spanish accent after studying for an hour with the Speech exercises. It would wear out after half an hour of not studying, but my wife thought I was doing it on purpose.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also, my Rosetta Stone online is saying that it's expired already and I've only had it a week...It won't let me access anything!####$$##%NEGATIVE
pimsbler works better####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like Pimsleur a lot better, too. It's more expensive, but definitely worth it. Pimsleur works how children work: listening to Mommy and Daddy. Many Chinese people say my Mandarin accent and pronunciation are very good. I think they're being kind, but the thing is, they understand what I say. For a tonal language like Mandarin, that is very important for understanding. I haven't gone through the whole course with Rosetta Stone, but I feel Pimsleur is a lot more effective, and much quicker.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is OK, but it cannot replace a real teacher!####$$##%NEGATIVE
My daughter used this program to help her learn Chinese.  However, she did find classroom instruction to be more beneficial.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's been pretty good so far, but I'm only on Level 1-3(?).####$$##%POSITIVE
I cannot even get started ---- it was a total waste of my money ----####$$##%NEGATIVE
There is no money back though ---thats the kicker --- I bought both French an Mandarin and I am stuck with $1000 worth of software that wont work####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes -- that is why I posted hee --- what am I going to do -- spend $5000 suing to get $1000 back? LOL####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yep --- they went public -- and now need to show a dividend ---####$$##%NEGATIVE
Our daughter in Texas is learning Spanish since she'll be in Bolivia doing her missionary work.  She said they are learning a lot using this program.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta stone is really good, if they priced thier software and service so normal pepole could afford it I think the world would communicate much better.####$$##%NEGATIVE
it is not perfect, but it works. many mistakes on gramma...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Very expensive, though...####$$##%NEGATIVE

would love this but $500.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great program####$$##%POSITIVE
You cant learn a language with Rosetta Stone. You learn how to parrot some words which is NOT learning a language. This false advertising is not a serious way to conduct business.####$$##%NEGATIVE
great program. I used this to teach my Hispanics English.####$$##%POSITIVE
As a language instructor myself, I can say that Rosetta Stone is all advertising and no substance. First of all, the product claims that it will have you "speaking" a new language. Speaking a language does not entail memorizing phrases and variations on a phrase. It actually does entail work: learning grammar, praticing verbs, setence structure, etc. I high doubt that at the end of a complete Rosetta Stone program in French, for example, someone could read Voltaire or discuss the history of French classical music in a Parisian cafe. Being able to do things like that means you SPEAK the language. With Rosetta Stone, though, you may able to say that the girl is under the airplaneat the end of the day and that is not, I am afraid, speaking a new language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone sucks. i've tried it. DO NOT BUY####$$##%NEGATIVE
I hear this is the best language instruction you can buy.####$$##%POSITIVE
Free must be a very loose term in other languages.  It took less than 1 minute for the salesperson to tell me the free trial was 79 dollars and then another 15 minutes of other ways to pay until I finally hung up the phone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't want this advertisement on my new feed ! Too much advertisement I didn't LIKE the page...####$$##%NEGATIVE
i thought i would like this. i am not interested because unfortunately, it does not offer my language to learn on demo....arabic. so how would i now if this was so wonderful?####$$##%NEGATIVE
BEST program ever invented! We bought our eldest the complete set ($800) and she really excellled. Getting the head set is a must! They even have payment plan options... get this!####$$##%POSITIVE
if a person could afford it that would be nice####$$##%NEGATIVE
hahaha....I would love to try this but it cost toooo much!####$$##%NEGATIVE
it doesnt work as they say####$$##%NEGATIVE
My son learned to speak German with this program.####$$##%POSITIVE
If somebody says, "The boy is under the airplane" you will understand them.  What a joke!####$$##%NEGATIVE

I'm using it to learn spanish, I think it is great.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, they have arabic. It's pretty awesome####$$##%POSITIVE
Non-functional Demo####$$##%NEGATIVE
duolingo dot com is better and free####$$##%NEGATIVE
I prefer Pimsleur. Better at about half the price.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Tried the demo and got an 87%.  The game didn't work well, so I stopped.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yea right! the free demo will end up costing you hundreds of bucks,and yes you will learn in a few min. how to say yes or no.RIP OFF.####$$##%NEGATIVE
BYKI is much less expensive and just as good.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nate do you own one of these?  They seem really really expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Are you learning another language Rosetta stone is too expensive I wanted to learn Hebrew I tried and tried it is very interesting but my mind can hold all of it but if it is preached I know it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I bought the French version and I love it! I learned french in middle school, high school, and got a minor in French in college. I started to loose it after a year and bought the program to keep up my studies. I wish they had this in middle school. It's freaking awesome, the way they present the language to you, so much easier. I'll be learning my 3rd language with Rosetta Stone, no doubt!####$$##%POSITIVE
The demo was fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
I like Pimsluer better####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is what I am using now to learn French. Such a great language learning tool :) Another good one I use is Pimsleur :)####$$##%POSITIVE
I so want this program.   Looks amazing!!!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I don't think Rosetta is a good language learning tool. I've tried it and now I'm taking a French class at the Beverly Hills Lingual Institute. Rosetta is all about 'phrases' but not about the little details. Instead of being a robot and only answering in phrases, a real language school will teach you everything you want to know.. Deuces..####$$##%NEGATIVE
too expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is really helpful I am currently using it.####$$##%POSITIVE
would love to do this, but too expensive for this gal####$$##%NEGATIVE
We have found the Michel Thomas tapes much more effective learning tools for languages than Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi, Alex. Personally, I had Rosetta Stone as one of the resources for use when teaching an ESL class in south GA for a college and was not impressed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Mary, have you used there tapes? I checked some out at Barnes & Nobles and thought they were quite expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
it's nice####$$##%POSITIVE
we have one...learning CHINESE...IT'S FUN!####$$##%POSITIVE
This is one of the better ones out there. However, it's pretty expensive. There is at least one very good free one onlinel####$$##%NEGATIVE

Livemocha isn't bad either and it's free!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It is a great program. Learned Italian with it.####$$##%POSITIVE
I love Rosetta Stone but I hate how expensive it is. MoneyWh0res####$$##%NEGATIVE
i heard thats the easiest way to learn a language####$$##%POSITIVE
I've completed both Rosetta Stone Spanish courses.  It's a good program for learning new words, but does a poor job teaching the rules of the language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Having studied language pedagogy for several years now and being a language teacher, I can tell you that this is based off of an old method that is generally not effective. You'll get some passive knowledge of some words and get to cobble them together in pre-rehearsed sentences with your tutor. You might feel like you've learned something, but it is essentially useless. It could be used as a supplement to a language course, though, if the course has it as a component (don't waste your money doing this in addition to, say, a high school or college Spanish class).####$$##%NEGATIVE
Highly recommended.####$$##%POSITIVE
really, Paulie Molfeta yu like rosetta stone at 315 am... ??? unreal facebook plops this crap in my newsfeed.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I would love to use Rosetta Stone but it's just too expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I bought this program for my AVID students at school and I have to say that they did amazingly well.  This is not to take away from the wonderul job that our Spanish teachers are doing at all, but it does teach conversational language in a hurry!####$$##%POSITIVE
you all need to lower your damn prices. your too damn expensive####$$##%NEGATIVE
They are good; if not the best!####$$##%POSITIVE
No, you won't! There is no learning language in "no time," as software sellers are trying to convince you. They are just a possible supplement to a thorough study of language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
if i could afford it i'd have it....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Too expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE
too much money####$$##%NEGATIVE
A minute after that, you'll need technical help.  But Rosetta Stone has absolutely horrible tech assistance, so you'll then be on your own.  And a warning: our machine had to go to the shop for a couple of weeks because Rosetta Stone messes up account protocols on Macs.  A great program from a horribly corrupt and technically incompetent company.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got the hook up....my daughter has this on her computer she speaks, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish along with her birth language english####$$##%POSITIVE
Pimsleur is less expensive and so far works for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE

How come Rosetta Stone doesn't teach Romanian?####$$##%NEGATIVE
My friend from from Brazil, who is Portuguese did not speak one word of English when I met her 4 yr ago.  Today she speaks very well except for our "expressions." Great tool.####$$##%POSITIVE
It lacks the languages that I need to know; Sanskrit, Avestan, and Tibetan.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Very expensive! In few minutes I learned Italian, Spanish, French and Romanian....it just took 5 minutes each just to say:buono, bueno, bien, bun...LOL!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's still the best teaching software money can buy! I used it for my ESL teachings with the Hispanic Ministry in Nashville for 8 years, and 870 of my students who never spoken English are leading productive lives because of this effective teaching software!####$$##%POSITIVE
That was my problem, the cost. I wanted to learn Hebrew. It would be easier to go to a jewish church.####$$##%NEGATIVE
sounds great, but way over priced####$$##%NEGATIVE
This doesn't work on old people like me....my brain doesn't comprehend.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Try duolingo.com, it's free and open source unlike rosetta stone####$$##%NEGATIVE
Unfortunately they discontinued the one I need; Danish. :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried the demo and I think it's a great way to learn another language. Would like to purchase but my budget doesn't allow at this time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry, but these programs don't work as well then taking a class in the university. Believe having English as my second language I know. Good luck.####$$##%NEGATIVE

why did this ad pop up on my daughters page as liked when she doesn't even know what rosetta stone is?? thats creepy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
^ yeah it is! I've found other sources which work better for me, everyone has different learning styles, but as far as Rosetta Stone goes... I have no idea because I can't afford it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I need her but she cost tooo much!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Pretty rotten demo. No sound. Wouldn't pay 10 cents for it based on this so called free demo.####$$##%NEGATIVE
FORGET Rosetta Stone try Duolingo (duolingo.com) it's 100% free, online and studies show people learn MORE in LESS time with Duolingo.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I don't subscribe to the ads and I understand that my face might be a nice way to drive traffic so facebook can look good and appear profitable to potential advertisers like yourself. However, it is something you should look into as the 'addvertiser' vs me, the person being used. Actually there was just a class action lawsuit regarding this type of use. It may still be going on. I thought I'd simply call your attention to it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've made a number of requests over the past several years using this form, afraid it's fallen on deft ears####$$##%NEGATIVE

.: Pro is okay, but not the ARM one. Be careful when purchasing :-)####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'd try the demo if it came in the language I would want to learn- Japanese!  Also, anyone making comments on speaking English in America....please don't procreate.  It's idiots like you that make Americans look like a bunch of backwater rednecks to the rest of the world.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I thought Rosetts Stone was the best... Until I experianced Pimsleur. Way better...####$$##%NEGATIVE
rosetta is the best####$$##%POSITIVE
I prefer The Pimsleur Approach in learning Spanish.####$$##%NEGATIVE
really - if that's so then why the hell is it so much - if it's so easy MILLIONS WOULD BUY IT AND  AT A RESONABLE COST####$$##%NEGATIVE
AWESOME PROGRAM.####$$##%POSITIVE
rosetta stone does not do any better then any other language educational tool that you can buy to put on the computer or tv or get for free.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This demo will not load. =/####$$##%NEGATIVE
another damned advertisement! Not appropriate!####$$##%NEGATIVE
it is fun but too pricey.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like Rosetta Stone,the Japanese language.,but it is so expensive####$$##%NEGATIVE
If what they say is true, that you can learn to speak a language in a couple months, then the cost of their program would be justified.  Unfortunately it takes a little bit longer to learn a language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Their program is garbage. I've used it before and spent hours on the same 6 words or so. That was with progressing through lessons and everything. Rosetta Stone...French translation means Garbage.####$$##%NEGATIVE
free demo will not come up on computer, another sham !!!!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
wonderful product!!  just too much money to purchase :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
very expensive for anything other than the sample disc####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone too expensive and not worth it for a language program!####$$##%NEGATIVE
i hear its a rip off !and not worth all that money!Theres cheaper of free on internet!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
hate rosetta stone. they are rude on the phone. don't do refunds. will NEVER buy any of their products ever again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry Rick, but Rosetta Stone SUCKS BIG TIME! I've been using it for over 2 years and have learned practically NOTHING from it. I just started using Pimsleur and got conversational in Spanish almost immediately! What a difference! Besides, Pimsleur is also so much cheaper than Rosetta Stone! What a RIP-OFF Rosetta Stone is! They ought to be prosecuted for FRAUD!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wish I could afford this.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It cost so much....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Their claims are wildly overblown. I used their italian course seriously for about a year and found that the infactn and adult learning processes are very different. Grammer for a highly inflected language is expecially difficult to learn in this way!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Loved the free demo cd!!! I know you can't put a price on learning a new language, but they are expensive :-( I took Spanish in high school because my dad told me that's the language I was going to take because you don't know anyone who speaks german ( what i wanted to take) years after school, I don't remember Spanish at all, but I remembered a good bit of what that cd taught me in german :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
But I'd be grateful if they'd coach their advertisers not to pronounce "Rosetta Stone" so it sounds like some woman's name!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well be aware I went to try free demo doesn't work.....probably a ploy to get your email address####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is okay, but it doesn't translate the words or phrases for you so you're never 100% sure what you're saying. It can also be frustrating when the program doesn't recognize what you're saying and tells you to repeat yourself over and over again. The best way to learn a language is to actually go to the country or spend time with a family or just someone who speaks the language. I learned much more French in one day visiting my family in Tahiti than I ever did with 2 years worth of Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Would love to, but I don't see Dutch as an option.####$$##%NEGATIVE
no, they do not have Slovenian####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am using this for French and it is amazing!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone does NOT have a Finnish course, there fore I do not like them!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have rosetta stone for spanish its rude it interrups u####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ad says "in 10 minutes you will be speaking a new language. I have had the program for more than 2 years and still can't speak French. Do you have to take it out of the box and install it on your computer, too?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would love to use Rosetta Stone, but despite many many requests...they still do not have a program that teaches American Sign Language :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Pimsleur is a much better language learning program.  Much more of a natural learning style.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like the idea of Rosetta Stone, but I also like paying my mortgage every month too. It's WAY too expensive!####$$##%NEGATIVE

I LOVE my Rosetta Stone Italian It works! I have a long way to go but I love the teaching method. In two lessons I already know quite q few vocabulary words and phrases! It's a beautiful language.####$$##%POSITIVE
yi jia fei ji shang mian de yi ge nan har...A chinese sentence you learn with this program. I took Chinese in college by the chinese teachers and students and learned it from my grandparents who are chinese. this program didnt teach you pronunciation, pinyin, or how to pronounce the alphabet or anything. when the chinese teach you to speak their language they start out with those main areas/subjects first. Before teaching you sentences or more complicated things. it didnt tell you what each word meant. it sucks. i only knew because I had prior training elsewhere.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is a scam...heavily marketed, but just try and learn a language effectively with it.  And they keep posting uninvited on my timeline.  Avoid them unless you just want to learn a few travel phrases you could pick up for free on line.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is too pricy AND  they don't even have the language I need.  BOOO!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Tried it here there were no instructions, I was frustrated####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone is not cheap!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was not impressed with the Spanish - only one I've tried####$$##%NEGATIVE
Go learn a language using the FREE and most of the time BETTER resources that are online. Don't spend $500 on their advertising campaign. Check out Livemocha.com It's Rosetta stone but free.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Spam.  The modern way to piss off your prospective customers by the thousands!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've never believed Rosetta Stone's claim that one can be speaking a new language in just minutes. I know 2 other languages besides English and I can promise you I didn't learn them in just minutes.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nathan Young didn't post anything about Rossetta. They are using his name without him knowing it. He's my nephew and I know for a fact he doesn't have access to his facebook at this time to post anything.####$$##%NEGATIVE

No, you are not mis-reading the system. After reducing the sessions to 25 minutes, they also cut the amount of studios to  2 per month. They will increase them to 4 a month soon. Also, customer service is not open on Saturdays. The changes started in October and got a lot of backlash. That is why they increased them to 4. It started with the USA and now it is in the UK. Who knows what the policy will be by next year??####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have had my 5 level course for over a year and have had problems with the discs from the start.  I can't get anyone from Rosetta support to even pay attention to my requests for help or support.  I have never received a reply back from them, so paid out all this money for virtually nothing.  How were you , or have you been able to get responses from their support?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I get 9120, 9114 errors####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks for the feedback.####$$##%POSITIVE

Oh a shoutout to my wonderful Portuguese coaches, Elaine, Cecilia, Ebe, Sandra Lina and Marcus who helped me to get to the point where I can actually do this! Thanks guys!####$$##%POSITIVE
So I checked all my emails and did not see the email, could you tell me what email address it was sent to in a private message?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well, I will have to call in again.  The remaining 3 discs have not been installed.  I am having a lot more problems with that. Sure don't know why this is happening.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Please help me####$$##%NEGATIVE
Windows 7, no error messages, just a completely nonresponsive system. I am trying to begin the first lesson of level 1 French. I bought a mic/headphone set with usb connector and installed the usb before I opened Firefox and went to www.rosettastone.com. (After failing to get started, I tried using Internet Explorer. No better). As soon as I select the first lesson I am toldto click Continue and  to speak into the mic in a normal voice. I had to do this repeatedly. Only one time did it recognize my voice and tell me to click Continue a second time. When I did this, it did not continue. One time it told me to run thru a troubleshooting sequence: quiet in the room, verify my mic was turned on and up, and to download the Audio Optimizer--which I tried to do. Something started downloading but when my download manager popped up and I tried to run it, nothing happened. So today I tried to sign on and find out how to download the Audi Optimizer again.I went to Help and searched for audio optimizer and nothing came up that would direct me to the download button. The Help popped away and the course tried to start again and now I can't even access the question-mark Help button. I really would like to cancel my online subscription and buy the more expensive discs instead. Of course there's a small problem with that: I used Paypal and thought I was paying $299, but after I completed the transaction I was informed that I have a 5 payment plan--which I didn't want and don't even know if Paypal can help me fix this problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
oh and I know you can manually click through repeating each screen or even worse just do a new user and start from the beginner either option isn't going to work for kids and it's annoying.####$$##%NEGATIVE
TKS...I Chat with RS yesterday, and now it`s working.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much. Paypal has sent me a receipt for the refund. I will buy the CDs right now.####$$##%POSITIVE

Hi Christy, thank you for the suggestion, but I've tried all those steps numerous times and it still doesn't work. The only thing that did work was when I had updated my adobe flash, but it stopped working again :( I'm not sure what to do anymore.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thanks Nathan ! Now i know what i need to look in a ntb :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Katie, I truly appreciate it. I sent you a personal reply. I look forward to using the iPad to continue my studies.####$$##%POSITIVE
I know a lot of people who use Rosetta Stone. I've also sold a few myself, I work at Best Buy! ;) No complaints, great product!####$$##%POSITIVE
The program works differently for different people.  For me, it is a good way to either get introduced to a language in which I need/want to become conversationally fluent or in which I need/want to communicate or one which I have studied and need more confidence to speak.  I use dictionaries and grammar books and make it into a course.  At the point where I can converse somewhat (after going through RS and whatever supplementary materials I use), I look for ways to use the language in my town or through language exchange.  I also look for ways to read the language and hear it over the internet.  I have completed 5 levels of German with RS, and it helped me actually speak the language after having completed 8 university courses.  In my humble opinion, the value in learning a language is actually using it to communicate.  So, it does work (as do most methods of instruction) but it depends on the person, their motivation, and desire to learn that language.####$$##%POSITIVE
RS is good in getting a foundation in a language. As Janice indicated, supplementary materials (dictionaries, talking to other speakers of the language, etc) is how you can actually get to advance in the language. There are ways to learn a language, just don't get stuck into thinking that you HAVE to stick with one method.####$$##%POSITIVE
but y spend 500 dollars to just get a starting foundation. Dont sound like its worth it to me. I can just get the books and start there for 90% of the price of rs. i wanted Spanish cause i have allot of spanish friends. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Katie, Yes I understand your policy, you only exchange if purchased from you. I purchased it from your reseller who is not offering any exchange even though it was their employees stuff up. The fact that I can't simply go to one of your local resellers is appauling. The box is unopened. All it would take is a swap of a box. That's it. As I said, very poor customer service.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. How long should I expect to wait before hearing back? I have wasted a lot of time on this already with re-installs and restarting my computers during my wait.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Katie! Thank you so much for actually commenting on this. The last associate that I talked to was very helpful and took care of the issue that the last two ones caused. I still have a good faith in your product and just purchased the one that I wanted. I keep my hopes up.  Thank you again.####$$##%POSITIVE
thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Be careful.  I paid for this and cant get it to work.  Support has been dismal and after several weeks of trying to get this to work as promised still no luck.  Not recommended from someone who has paid for this and has not been able to use it due to poor customer care.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah. that was a total bust and completely ineffective. I spent 30 minutes waiting to find that out! Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
And I've just confirmed with the bank that this problem is squarely Rosetta Stone's. A live chat AND a 30 minute wait to talk to a real person BOTH were unable to handle the problem. I think I should just sign up for a real class and stop wasting my afternoon chasing whatever the problem is on your end. This is nuts.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Christy, thank you very much for this. I don't happen to be at home right now, but am anxious to try this!####$$##%POSITIVE
The customer service with Rosetta Stone is a little bit ridiculous, don't you think? It has been 9 hours since I posted my results here and no one has bothered to send additional help options.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Also just realized that for almost the same price as a six month subscription to the swahili level 1 course (the only level available) I could OWN all 5 levels of French or Spanish. I find this really upsetting and honestly am really angry with myself for trusting that your Swahili course would be as exemplary as everyone says your other language courses are.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i keep trying to unlike it but i cant seem to do it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your quick and extremely informative response. It was very helpful in making a decision as to what language we are going to pick. We are going with the Spanish: Latin America. I thought that was the one that would be used more in the United States, but wanted to confirm before purchasing. Also, is it correct that up to 5 people can learn Spanish on the program, it can be installed on 2 computers and that the headphones do NOT come with the program? Sorry for all the questions, but we are looking to purchase it this weekend and I would like to have all the info before doing so. Thank you again!####$$##%POSITIVE

I am upset about this too.  I live in Canada.  I was going to take advantage of this TODAY but I need the payment plan.  Anyway, the search continues.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Move a little faster please Rosetta Stone.  I had wanted to order French & Latin through you but not without a payment plan.  "Solutions" for Canadian customers are not this hard to come up with.  There are a ton of American companies that are able to offer payment plans to Canadian customers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thank you all last night i tried to load my language it didnt work but i read your message and trid it one more time and its working now thanks for your help :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi Christy, I have received the previous e-mails, tried the steps included, and contacted McAffee as instructed. I have it working well enough now with the under age account and I'm not going to mess with it anymore. It was a painful process to get here and, as I mentioned, I don't know that it was worth it. It would be nice if customer service was more responsive and, perhaps, had better tools. I have the impression that the customer service resources are limited and the training isn't uniform since your instructions varied from the chat reps I communicated with.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just want to follow up that within the last few minutes RS has confirmed they have finally fixed the error.....but why six months? And any one who can offer any insider knowledge to resolving problems in a more timely manner would be most welcome.  Also if anyone at RS can answer why throughout this whole process did every customer rep that answered the phone or online help was not informed of RS's policy that anyone with continuing membership prior to October 14, 2012 was not limited to a specific number of sessions? This was written online in small letters below the new policy of limited sessions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your input. The computer error I referred to was described to me as a "computer glitch" by various agents throughout last fall and winter. Nonetheless Spring is here and I look forward to continuing my progress learning Swedish!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Awesome! Thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Got it up and running last night and already did one of my lessons. Yay! Thanks again!####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone has spelling sections. they are not easy witch is what makes them so good.####$$##%POSITIVE

Yes, thats me :) , perfect thanks####$$##%POSITIVE
still waiting for a response! going to have to contact customer services again. grrrr! I'm getting charged but not getting access. Glad yous got sorted. Fingers crossed they're able to fix mine soon.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Christy! It worked just fine. I am very grateful for your help. :)####$$##%POSITIVE

It was just working and stopped. I got an error message:  We expect you to be speaking here, and we aren't detecting any input from your microphone. Would you like to launch microphone setup?####$$##%NEGATIVE
sounds good. thank you brother :)####$$##%POSITIVE
hey Steve  heres something to  ponder....  it's the arrogance  of  an american company  that says Canadien  french  is not worth the effort   but  yet  thinks  that 9 american english ) is a real dialect. we canadians  know that the  USA does not think much of us   . you have proven that over the years  , butthis   little farce is so beyond stupid!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks, I am almost finished with the RS French and wanted to start my Korean lessons, thanks for the information.####$$##%POSITIVE
I sent for the free trial but it never came. So I just gave up on trying. They always send me free trails up I never get them.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I own several languages. It is quite expensive. However it IS worth the price  if your seriously wanting to learn : )####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank u so much I will try those. I did not know about ant of the information u have. That may help alot. Thanks once again.####$$##%POSITIVE
I am supprised you are not promising to do much. Racism and stereotypes are the best you can do?  ####$$##%NEGATIVE
can you believe people are too ignorant to even know what racism looks like. have you seen that stupid ad? ####$$##%NEGATIVE
you havent seen the spanish add. and you wouldnt understand it anyway####$$##%NEGATIVE
its not the phrase. ill post yhe video and a translation of the lyrics. ####$$##%NEGATIVE
Tried it again just in case - Adaptive Recall Level 1 Unit 1 Lesson 3 - it will not pick up my voice after the first 4 words.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Moved on to Pronunciation Level 1 Unit 3 Lesson 4. It picked up my first 3 words and then quit - now it won't recognize even 1 word.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've tried 3 different USB ports. Ensured the USB microphone is the default (even though it's the only one). Disabled anything that might have possibly caused a problem - though there are no other mics.  :( I just want to use my software.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am not having trouble with the online audio Christy. I was saying that I'm having trouble with the audio in my Rosetta Stone software program. I only have the headset that I purchased in my Rosetta Stone package. I will reconfirm that I have no audio issues using the online access when I get home this evening.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have the same issue. No success even after reading the article stated above.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Thanks for the reply but no, I have tried the steps in the article and still not working####$$##%NEGATIVE
BRILLIANT....Thankyou yes this has worked :-)  thanks again####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank u admin for answering me! & I've seen the homepage it's amazing!   ####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta is a site for the owners benefit only.it does not offer standard Thai not to mentions my dialects . They offer the languages that are common and easy .This is not a good company . I would never buy Rosetta.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Great! I'll be the first to buy it when it's ready! Thx####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
thank you for responding!####$$##%POSITIVE
and for the info####$$##%POSITIVE
Even then, an immersion experience NEEDS translation to clarify things once in a while. I experienced that many a time during my travels overseas.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would agree with Sean... i am struggling to figure out what i'm saying in Spanish..####$$##%NEGATIVE
i see a pic of a man drinking Water or eating something.. and i speak a Spanish phrase or a word and i'm thinking what the hell does it mean? I can imitate sounds perfectly but don't see the reasoning behind not having a translation.. this alone is keeping me from buying it####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
J'ai étudié le français pendant un an, et n'a pas vraiment appris quelque chose. Six mois avec Rosetta Stone et je peux parler, lire et comprendre le français. mais vous devez avoir raison. il ne fonctionne pas. sarcastique.####$$##%POSITIVE
But adults don't learn as a child does. How does this type of Dynamic Immersion work?####$$##%NEGATIVE
After five days with no reply to my email, this really helped a bunch! WOW! Maybe Rosetta Stone isn't really as concerned with piracy as they say they are? If you actually appreciated my email you would have replied to it! Makes one wonder if maybe someone in the anti-piracy department is the pirate? Guess I'll try harder to get contact information for people in your staff positions and let them know personally.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not me personally...my daughter...she's 15...and I'm very satisfied with her progress...thanks Katie.####$$##%POSITIVE
Sara, I can't access your message, I am completely locked out of the system. Any attempt to log on takes me to the 'no product rights' page. Please send an email to the email address within my profile.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Right. I understand all about dynamic immersion and having no translations. As I said for clarification purposes. Later in to the 3rd disc I found it to be somehwhat confusing. I had to use a different source to provide a translation. I think in order to save time it would be nice to offer a translation at some point is all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Appreciate it : )####$$##%POSITIVE
Your not really reading what my issue is thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
And pay much more money ; )####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried to call the number but its not work, can you please retype the phone number in international fourm####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for your consideration. I would really appreciate being able to use it. ####$$##%POSITIVE
Just received a call from a gentleman in your legal department and had a pleasant conversation with him. All that I needed from this was to know that someone, a real person not an automated system, had received this email to confirm that I hadn't wasted my time reporting this. This took care of that need for for me so I can now put it to rest. As for your previous reference to the form I submitted not generating email replies, I didn't submit a form, I sent an email to your piracy email address which is why I was expecting a response. Have a great day.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ok, thank you for the reply. The problem is, that Chinese and Russian are not Norwegian. :-P####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sean,  It works almost subconsciously. For some time I was pretty skeptical on the dynamic immersion process (they should still offer a translator for clarification though) however I noticed I was answering questions correctly and I did not understand how I did this. It works in an insidious way. So it works for sure, just not in the way you'd expect it. Ps. Adults who are immersed in a different country learn that language faster due to being full immersed in said environment. Dynamic immersion is the most efficient way by far! ####$$##%POSITIVE
Bro, you really need to consider RS, you will be amazed how fast you can learn a language. It took me a long time to learn Samoan, but with Rosetta Stone I learned French pretty fast, I just need to practice using my new language. I have French televison thru my cable company and I also order French magazines, I try to make a French attempt everyday.####$$##%POSITIVE
Cheap, you can pay for them monthly and you get free help, My daughter started the Spanish, now shes on the French RS, we plan to buy a home perhaps in Montpellier or Provence,####$$##%POSITIVE
Let me buy the spanish from you then because it's too expensive for me to go get at somewhere like bestbuy.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Marquette Holt  , trust me its cheap, especially since they break out your payments, once we get back from Korea in two years the girls and I will be jumping on Spanish. Call the number on Rosetta Stones FB and trust me you will be a believer in how they teach new language learning.####$$##%POSITIVE
Mine will only work if online####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wonderful, that answers my question perfectly. I appreciate your time!####$$##%POSITIVE
I had the same issue. Can you explain to me too??  Thanks ####$$##%NEGATIVE
It was on the website yesterday. I was gonna buy it with my tax return but then when you get to check out it would be full price. I guess I'll just wait until the next promotion and hope that I have the extra money by then.####$$##%NEGATIVE
it worked, thanks!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you for your prompt response. I'd really appreciate your follow up Email. Thank you Jonathan.####$$##%POSITIVE
I enjoy the sessions so much and wouldn't have come nearly as far as I have without them, but they are getting really, really, really hard to schedule.  It seems like there were a lot more available times last summer when I started RS.  Now, most of the available sessions are for several days ahead.  This makes it hard when you can only schedule two sessions at a time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you! Wow, that was fast . .####$$##%POSITIVE
nevermind! rosetta stone is cool!####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much for your help. How do I get the TOTALe subscription?####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for your response. I'm actually spending less time on Facebook,,, tired of being flooded with ads.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree with you completely. My tech problem is solved now so I can schedule again but if I had been able to schedule the way I would have liked to all along there would have been no need to purchase another month of RS studio.####$$##%NEGATIVE
get me off this junk marketing. how did this start remove my Facebook book account####$$##%NEGATIVE
Nathan, I did run through this procedure with direct messages, excuses, etc. - do you guys have no more a phone for calling!?####$$##%NEGATIVE
For the community: I did read the message, it was rude and inappropriate.####$$##%NEGATIVE
They also charge for phone help now!! Its so annoying. You buy the expensive product and if you need any help they charge you extra to actually talk with someone on the phone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah the price even on the payment plan is a bit excessive especially on a military income for myself.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much for the information Katie. I filled the form out and submitted it.####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes, I have sent you with more detail information. Thanks so much for your prompt action.####$$##%POSITIVE
with rosetta stone it is a very simple program that kids of all age can enjoy I am actually trying to push a program to utilize rosetta stone in my school system www.freelibertarians.com but your child shouldn't have too difficult of a time.####$$##%POSITIVE
It would make sense to cut the price to accommodate the change.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry, I don't understand. How 4 classes of 25min per month is gonna provide me a better experience? I had the course since last year and I had to stop, now that I decide to come back is this the 'update' version? I doesn't look better in any way for me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Sara, so just to be clear... from 45 daily classes that I could do now I can do 1 hour per month. Is that?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm seeing fb posts on my timeline., The fact that you are uninvited and advertising on my fb offends me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The online access has a time limit on it.. that's not convenient for me.. I want to buy it once and then have it forever.####$$##%NEGATIVE
5 levels go for ~$500, so one level ought to be $100 or less, considering you've got those special promotions every other month or so . . . how fail must a company be if they're so darn reluctant to please their customers properly?!  I guess I'll just buy books that teach me how to learn French -- that way I save a lot of money, and I'll be happy because this cut-throat crap company rosetta stone ain't getting my cash -- DON'T REPLY ! ! !####$$##%NEGATIVE
O.K., the part with pirated software was a semi-joke. I'm loyal to your brand, just want you to make it easier for me to purchase your goods..  Here's my real problem:  A long time ago, back when the French version only had 2 levels available, namely: lvl 1 & lvl 2; so I bought it..  Then many years later I installed it again, then wanted to buy levels 3, 4, and 5, but found out, to my dismay, that in order to acquire these I'd have to pay a price that included paying for levels 1 and 2 again..  Do you see my point now?####$$##%NEGATIVE
................................................... get it done, then you rock, otherwise you'll be known as the stale company, who's unable to adapt properly.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Il y a beaucoup de gens qui aiment Rosetta Stone, moi aussi. Je suis presque prete a fait a vacance a Provence ou Lyon, Merci a Rosetta Stone.####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone Version 2 is the best for advanced vocabulary and grammar. Please go back to that format.####$$##%POSITIVE
Personally, I do not understand why they have to insist that no translation is needed to learn a language through them. Even Berlitz - the actual inventors of the "Dynamic Immersion" technique back in the 1880's use translations and explain grammar whenever needed in the student's native language.  And to say that you learn as a child is an insult. We are not children AND a child's grammar or pronunciation is corrected when possible by an adult. Adults need rules to figure things out. Trying to notice and observe patterns and comparing them to pictures (especially when the sentence does not make sense in a real world setting) only leads to frustration and confusion.   Dynamic Immersion as defined by Rosetta Stone’s understanding does not exist at all in this world. You can go everywhere and your native language is either understood or used. So you will find someone who will explain things to you and correct you when needed in your own language. I’ve experienced that many times in my travels to Europe  I believe in giving the language materials to learn, and providing a translation to fall back on, and to explain the more intricate details of grammar where they are most confusing - especially the advanced stages of grammar.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So a language course with translations is what i seek.. and i've posed this question before to Rosetta Stone and get no reply####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well if ur child is in school see if the school offers a program my child is 7 yrs old n its working for her thanks to her school that helped me....####$$##%POSITIVE

The reason I want so much to learn the language is because my girlfriend is filipino. She speaks english but her family, not too well...Also it's a nice challenge to learn a new language. I love it !!####$$##%POSITIVE
Just to anticipate, he's trying to access the Rosetta Stone Course using the iPhone app. But he's getting the error:  "there are no languages available" (MC3005). So we tried to use the website, and again: "You don't currently have online services. You can always use Rosetta Course on this computer, but you're missing out on Rosetta Studio tutoring sessions, Rosetta World games and activities, and mobile apps!". The point here is, he do not have 4 5 months using the tool, we bought that 2 licenses 5 students package, and a friend of ours are using normally, also, she's able to use the web tools until september.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have had the program for several years. it has never performed well at all. i finally decided to buy an alternative language package. but thank you for the follow up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much but i can't do that it's fail because when i start it the program want me download de-De_f_1.3.12.zip-WinRAR. I downloaded already but i don't know how to do a next step.####$$##%NEGATIVE
IT is extremely expensive when comparing with apps.Have you hear about them?Paying more than 100 for any software is to encourage piracy.Here in the 3rd world is insane to pay  the equivalent to 3 minimum wages for this####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you very much!####$$##%POSITIVE
Yes many times. This software is sub-par.####$$##%NEGATIVE
thanks Nathan, but that still does not explain why an older version 3 with only one level is more expensive than your other products and does not qualify for discount promotions? How can you justify the same price tag for less than 1/5 of the other updated program... That is just poor support in my opinion. After doing the 1st lesson for free as a trial, if I pay $200+ subscription I only get 4 more lessons.. :( I cannot justify this..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you for the link Nathan.  I've tried this already, and it doesn't get to the activation screen, it goes to the "Add A Language Level" Dialogue box and then it when I click on it ask me to insert the CD.  Since I purchased the digital download, I don't have the CD.  Do you know how to resolve this?  Thx.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi ...Thanks to y'all....my motivation are my family, my future in this country depend a lot of my education and specifically the English language...####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks to you all behind this prestigious brand####$$##%POSITIVE
I find it interesting. I've seen requests for Norwegian and other languages for about 2 years now and it seems all requests are followed up with a "fill out a request for [language name] form"...I gave up on waiting for Basque after a 5 year wait and went with something else.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Los anormales que hacen la traduccion. Asi hacen en los eventos oficiales, ponen a traducir uno que dice lo que le da la gana, no lo que la persona en realidad dijo. Eso me enfurece.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you so much.  However I never used the class room and discussions from the totale when I first bought it.  Looking to just activate the app.  I'm guessing right now it is a all or nothing type of offer?  If this helps to open up the app in the future I'd totally be interested in just paying for the app to be open even if it was on a year sub basis.  Besides that in all 3 of my lessons I never used those other features while I had them (just the type of learner I am).    Thanks again for the quick and helpful customer service you guys always seem to provide.####$$##%POSITIVE
I know Cheryl, I started this week.. doing great and enjoying the social aspect of learning with 5 other persons! :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Well, since now it is down to 3  , from 38 , basically available May 22 to 25th , I do have a doubt.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just looked, and though there may be 100 studios overall, there are 12 units with 2 studio levels per unit.  That is 24 levels.  With 100 studios, that is only about 2 or 3 per level, and that is exactly what I see on the system.  Also, compared to other languages that have 100 per unit (50 or more per level), that just isn't a lot.  Pair that with the fact that they are all later in the month, it causes a problem for those of us who want to get the studios. RS should really evaluate how many studios that offer at each level and ensure that they have at least one or two per level that people can schedule during any given week.  Someone has dropped the ball, and if coaches are leaving, they need to start looking for people to replace them.  I would rather RS say that they are having a few staffing problems and are trying to resolve them than to continue pretending that nothing is wrong.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good to know! I was going to choose Portuguese as my next language. Are you even able to schedule the 4 - 25 minute studios per month that you are ''allowed''?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well right now it would be difficult to get what they said they are offering because you have to finish 2 core lessons before you can take a class so with almost nothing being offered until May 22, I don't know how you could do that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Do you mean more than 100 sessions in total?  That really isn't a lot compared to the other languages and also considering that there are 24 different levels ( 12 units at 2 per unit), that is only about 2 a level, on average.  Some have only two or three sessions available and they are in late May.  I am looking at the schedule as I write this and just logged on, so I am sure that the system is updated.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You have a hundred sessions available starting a couple of weeks from now and that is adding up the 3 to 4 sessions available for each level. You do not have 100 studios available in any level , where as in French and Italian that I take there are 250 to 300 sessions for EACH class totaling  thousands as opposed to the mere 100 you are talking about. Do your comparison on any one lesson in these 3 languages and you will see. My system is up to date. Your info is not my info talking about each time you try to get a particular class, ANY class and you have 3 sessions available May 24 or so. There are not enough coaches. Lina only has a couple of sessions I believe on Thurs. , Ebe  a few sessions and Marcus and Cecilia have the most . Which if you put the hours they have together , you have less than 3 coaches. Obviously , no one there is caring about Portuguese and I am wondering why you are taking people's money and still offering it if you can't do any better than that. Just tell it like it is and get rid of it and don't take people's money for it if it is not a money maker for you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
If you tried sending one it didn't come through as of yet.####$$##%NEGATIVE
ITS HERE!  I cannot wait to get home and start!####$$##%POSITIVE
They can justify it because they are Rosetta Stone! Sorry for the sarcasm but this is standard operating procedure for RS. Not exactly a customer focused business model. Since Indonesian is being discontinued, you'd think they'd just say, Hey, just give the customer access as a goodwill gesture hoping you may purchase another language in the future.   Full time study for 4 months is your best option for learning any language because you'll have real, live, native speakers to practice with. Speech recognition and 4, 25 minute studio sessions will not make anyone conversationally fluent. Good luck with Indonesian! It always fascinates me that there are so many languages spoken across the globe.####$$##%NEGATIVE
buenos días ya pude recuperar mi acesso el problema es que ahora la pantalla se ve toda negra ,creo que algunos compañeros habian ajustado la opcion de internet, me puede enviar ese correo paraa justarlo tambien y volver a reiniciar donde  me quede..mil gracias por sus atenciones JOVANNA####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you. If I was able to buy  Just one level, makes no sense to have buy something I already have in order to get The next two cd's .####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Randi, I don't see it in my messages?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, we seem to be kept in the dark about why this is happening in Portuguese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
If this is the way it is going to be, we really need to know so we can make our decisions and we need to know if this is a temporary problem RS is having getting coaches or if it is going to be a permanent state of affairs or maybe get worse.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Perfect, fixed it! Thank you :)####$$##%POSITIVE
Can't send it :-( There's no notification of successful sending!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have a suggestion. When a child is young, and when a child learns to talk, they learn really basic words like, mom, dad, sister, brother, etc. Then they start being able to put the simple words into sentences and so on. Meaning, level 1 is really difficult to understand what they mean. I am guessing on what the phase is saying, for I all know I could be saying something that would make me look foolish. I feel as level 1 is like a level 3 or something. I have no background of Chinese as far as knowing it. If I don't have to be familiar with the language, then why is it so difficult to learn and understand what the picture and characters are saying. I am not trying to be rude, but I am trying to make a point. That point is that Rosetta Stone has a good program, but it is too advanced for a beginner.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I clicked on the hyperlink you gave me, but when I clicked on level 1 Chinese, it still was all in Chinese. I meant, it would be nice if it would be in english.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree. They should be made a little easier for beginners. I've always said adults are not children and do not think like a child, but would rather have rules explained - especially how a language works.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Katie!  I already paid a lot of money for those apps, for all five levels.  Who gave Rosetta Stone permission to access my computer and then have the audacity to require me to pay again to get them back???  I REQUEST TO BE "GRANDFATHERED."  i.e., given on-access to those apps (interactive session, games and stories) that I already paid for. at no additional cost.  NOT FOR THREE MONTHS!  I bought five levels and I will be working with the program for a couple of years as I intend to become fluent and German is a tough language.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I understand you want to get the word out about the Mother's Day special, but over 1.7 emails per day is not only excessive, it's annoying.  I'd LOVE to get relevant news and specials from Rosetta Stone in my inbox, but it is a privilege, and due to abuse, the company has now lost that privilege.  I've unsubscribed.  Please forward my comments to your marketing decision makers.  They need to rethink this one.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This what the spam filter is made for.####$$##%NEGATIVE
As another customer, I have to say I feel your pain, but I guess you didn't read the fine print...?  It have the Mandarin set and the TotalE part of it is a subscription based service and only came with 6 months of service (on my purchase).  I can use the rest of it until the end of time.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Victor ... I have installed all 5 discs but when I go to activate them it comes up with a 8812 and a message that reads 'This activation code is not valid. It may be installed on another computer. please verify your activation code and re-enter.' ... which I have done but the same message reappears ... thank you for looking into this !####$$##%NEGATIVE
The scam is that I paid 500 bucks for an entire set that I now can't seem to use because of some update that I don't want or need. Unless Spanish has some how changed since I purchased the product, what is it for?  So I called the number from the website and the guy tells me he can't help me unless I pay more money. But I could use the chat format. Junk. I worked with one person for about 30 mins. No success. And then to boot, we got disconnected. I worked with a new person for about 3 mins and we lost connection. After 2 hours of wasted time, I didn't even want to study it anymore. It's just not worth the trouble. If I can sell it and buy one that doesn't require a computer relationship, I'd take it in a minute.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Then why I get an e-mail from Rosetta Stone, announcing this service, if it's not available ?####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's in the App.  From the Rosetta Stone page I click the quiz App icon and it takes me to the app.  Then I click to log in with Facebook.  Then it says "you are NOT logged in".####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks! I know you used to have it but now you dont :(####$$##%NEGATIVE
Wrong, Josh.  I read every word of the agreement.  I was sold a package that included interactive sessions, games and stories.  They were removed without permission from my computer by Rosetta Stone. You may have a newer version and obviously your agreement differs from mine. I appreciate your comment, though, and that you took a moment to write.  I just wish anyone from Rosetta Stone could point out to my why what they did was OK.  I loved the product but now have half of what I paid for and all I can say is buyer beware.  Rosetta Stone rips off their customers and does not have the courtesy to address their issues.  By the way, I have tried for months to get someone from Rosetta Stone to SPEAK WITH ME.  If what you suggest was correct, I would love to be told that by them and shown where in my agreement it says such a thing.  I would apologize and back down. But, NO ONE WILL EVEN SPEAK WITH ME.  Rosetta Stone stinks!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Interesting. The same thing is happening with RS Portuguese. Right now they have a few lessons available June 5th to 8th about 2 in each lesson. Lesson 12 has none available at all. There are a few available here and there before many due to cancelations. I wonder if they are phasing out these languages without telling us. People are still buying them so it is not fair to those people or to present members.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I find it interesting you've been asking about this for a couple of weeks and still no answer...I've asked questions before and get no answer either. Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Best language learning system ever - iPad version is perfect !####$$##%POSITIVE
I had an sd card in and thought maybe the card was giving a problem.  I removed the sd card and did a hard reset of the nook.  Same problem.  I then downloaded a voice recording app  (thinking maybe the microphone wasn't working)...it records just fine.  Now the entire app won't download...here is the error..."An error occured. Speech Recognition will be disablesd for this session. (CW203)(MLS10).  I then hit OK.  and then attempt to download level 1 unit 1 lesson 1 (which it doesn't download), and the next error is "There was an error in the application. (CW305)(MLS10)." Originally, about a month ago, I was able to download the Level 1 unit 1 & 2.  Now nothing will download.  I hope this helps you solve the problem.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Christy, you were on the right track.  I reinserted the SD card and still had the problem.  SD cards are relatively inexpensive so I purchased another sd card for about 14 dollars.  This one was 8 gig.  The one I had in originally was 32 gig.  The Rosetta Stone Companion App is working just perfect with the 8 gig SD card.  I talked with the sales rep at Best Buy and he said many people are saying they are having problems using the 32 gig with the nook tablet.  Just something to keep in mind when troubleshooting a nook problem.  I want to thank you for taking the time to help me with my problem.    I can't say enough about how great the program is and how helpful the support group is.  Thanks again.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have noticed that on the French lessons as well.  You really have to study the picture to try to figure it out and sometime you miss.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am finishing Unit 9.  I took a unit 6 studio because, when I tried to schedule a unit 9 one, at the time there weren't any.  When the coach asks related questions, and you have to respond not just to the pictures, is the best part of the studio.  Unfortunately, with three other people and only 25 minutes, it is really difficult to get momentum.  Once you get into the studio, it is over.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This change from Level, Unit, Lesson to the new format confuses me...I had to look at my screen to figure out what Unit 9 was!  :-)####$$##%NEGATIVE
It seems the sessions for Portuguese are lessened also....####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the input Sean. I hope the limited sessions is not another of one of their attempts to save money by cutting services. I think last year at the beginning of summer this happened but not as severe as now. When I talked to RS last week no one seemed to know anything about it and gave me the typical runaround. Lets hope for quick results!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I got the pdf files that you sent me. The only problem is that they are a printed transcript of the core lessons (30 minutes) and the milestones. They are not a proper dictionary or what would be called in German Worterbuch (dictionary) I am using Klett's Modern German and English Dictionary, yet it is not quite sufficient in looking up the more obscure words of German found in the course.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Martin! I am glad to hear that you like Rosetta Stone's latest improvements. From experience, I can tell you that Rosetta Stone really is the language-learning of the future. Nobody else can offer you such innovative and effective solutions! They are always making changes for the better, and have an entire Customer Success team dedicated to helping you along your language-learning journey! If you are contemplating learning a new language, Rosetta Stone is definitely the right choice :)####$$##%POSITIVE
K,  I sent it. Thanks. Oh! On your demo a few sections would not let me make a selection. can I go through the demo again? Arigatou gozaimasu.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just not Portuguese because they have hardly any studios. Sad.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's a great application and training aid.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thankfully, I have Version 4! Thanks so much!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a very useful button. It helped me through the years to get the pronunciation - especially since I'm now learning Hindi.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks Katie for your help####$$##%POSITIVE
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that they have run ads on Limbaugh's show.  I really think that they need to be more diligent in their oversight of their marketing.####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is not the first time that someone has complained.  There were complaints a few months back.  I think that they pulled the ads then, but someone let them leak through again.  They need to get a new marketing/PR firm if these are coming out again on Limbaugh's show.####$$##%NEGATIVE
With Portuguese, one someone brings it to their attention, they add more.  I don't think that they are on top of it.  i did hear that some coaches left.  Maybe, that is the reason for fewer studios.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sorry, no, I'm not learning Portuguese (already speak it). But from comments I've been seeing from others, there's been some "cuts" going on with other languages.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Guten Morgen, das ist ja toll, weil ich schon geschaut habe und es das Angebot mit den 240 Euro nicht mehr gibt. Ich warte nur bis mir das Geld auf meine Kreditkarte gut geschrieben wurde, dann werde ich mich bei dir melden. Vielen Dank!!!####$$##%POSITIVE
I agree!  Most of the studios for Portuguese are a week or two out.  I am almost finished with the program, but would really like to get some studios in so that I can get some practice before I go "mainstream".  More coaches would help.  There have been posts further down on this subject.####$$##%NEGATIVE
THANKS VERY MUCH!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hi, thanks for the reply  - no, it didn't help...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Already tried that. We cannot continue further without creating a learner - when we do that it says we are already registered and will not allow us to create a new profile. When we enter the email address recognised, it says to click to renew password  - do that and no email is sent...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't get that far - I open the app, and it goes straight to the new learner screen. I can;t create a new learner, and so round and round we go. MAddening!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Randi - where's the message? I cannot access anything to do with rosetta stone, and there's no message here on FB.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I can't log in to Rosetta Stone, create a new learner or get beyond that. I am totally stuck!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have been doing Portuguese for a very long time and although it never was as popular as the others, what is happening now is not at all the way ever was. Please don't tell me it is because it is not as popular. You guys are not keeping your end of the deal here.  Never did we have to book two weeks in advance and why are they not replacing at least one of the coaches who left. One thing is not to have the same number of sessions but to have 35 when others have 350 is a little bit far fetched. We are paying for studios and where are they???????? So we had 4 coaches with a lot of classes and 2 with a lighter load. Now we have 2 with a lot of classes and 2 with a lighter load. That is not enough; it is not right to have to wait 2 weeks to get a class and it might not be any where near the level that we want.  People who had the program before have been given the opportunity to continue with unlimited sessions; however if you can only get 2 once every 2 weeks if you book in advance that comes to 4 so what happened to availability for unlimited sessions that are costing $25  extra a month when you can't get them?. Also I want you to know that I know for a fact that this has never occurred in Portuguese before. I took 300 live classes  in one year and at least 200 were in Portuguese. So please don't give me this kind of simplistic answer. I want the truth about why coaches aren't being replaced and what is going on in Portuguese.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I need to learn Tagalog can Rosetta Stone give me £100 off my course? Can't do it till August though, as going to Uganda####$$##%NEGATIVE
XP, part of the problem I noticed is you have to over-enunciate some things.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Randi, I'm loving it! Never thought I'd enjoy learning a new language, I used to hate it at school. I'm just going to redo a couple of lessons to touch up on my listening skills then I'll be moving on to unit 2! YES!####$$##%POSITIVE
I got awlays rosetta stone msg, what is that? I can'nt understand, that msg####$$##%NEGATIVE
Anybody else notice this language program spelled "answered" wrong in the quiz?####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's been the same for other languages ... Norwegian ... Basque ... to name a couple. Still waiting to see them in the listing, but all we get for an answer is a fill out a request for language form on their website.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you! Will do. PS: I'm loving the Spanish discs but ASL has become a must learn vs. a want to learn. :-)####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm been asking for them to offer Portuguese for several years.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Samuel... don't hold your breathe waiting. I've been asking for Portuguese for over 5 years.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Agreed. It is a sad situation. Seems like they don't want to hire coaches to replace the ones who left.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Any news on more Portuguese studios? I want to get into studios for unit 11 over the next week, but there are only ones starting June 22.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jonathan, although they keep saying they will help you, they don't. It is just words to sound good. I got as far as finding out they would deliver the messages about Portuguese lack of coaches to the Studio Manager and never heard anything more and things continue as they are with very few studios to choose from and eventually  that go down to 0.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's like asking, "When is [language name] going to be available?" and the only answer is to fill out a language request form....yet nothing is done. I've seen languages being requested for a few years and still, nothing.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It seems like there's never going to be more than the 30 languages offered. Lots of requests for languages, but nothing getting added. Sad...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi Scott; In order to learn a language you should be able to practice speaking it with a native speaker. RS offer studio sessions but now these sessions are only 25 minutes long and you are limited to only 4 sessions per month. Therefore in one month, you may actually only practice your language with a native speaker for about 20 minutes. The sessions could have up to 4 students with one coach. When I started my learning journey, the sessions were 50 minutes long with no limit as to number of sessions available. To me, this is providing a disservice to customers. Best of luck!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I answer the quesion and the game takes forever to respond####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jonathan - the iPad can have multiple language keyboards installed simultaneously.  Why not just use those? I can type English and Russian into any app on my iPad, because i have both keyboard layouts installed. So i don't see why it's an issue for RS? Admittedly it means you're limited to a "true" keyboard layout, not a phonetic one, but that's still better than nothing!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I also love Prospero. It is my favorite game. It is very helpful####$$##%POSITIVE
You are a scam artist who does the bait and switch routine. Your company promised one thing but did not deliver it. Instead you try to sell me your product without keeping your promise of the free demo disk. You have no honor.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still no response from the CEO. I did receive an offer of some private sessions but that is not satisfactory. They have never explained why they offered me unlimited sessions and now have retracted that offer. They can, however, offer me additional sessions at the drop of a hat. Strange!####$$##%NEGATIVE
You have convinced me to stay away from RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Simply unlike the page as I just did in order to stop the daily barrages of the travel IQ test post.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank-you for your quick response####$$##%POSITIVE
Even with you great sale it's still not a opt. really sad####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks Randi--that helps tremdously!####$$##%POSITIVE
Hallo Stefanie, keine Ursache, habe ich doch gerne gemacht. Die Leute haben mir unglaublich geholfen und so fachlich und schnell! Ich war begeistert! Bei der Gelegenheit wollte ich Dich fragen, ob gibt es irgendwelche Einstellung, dass man die Anweisungen in Deutsch haben könnte? Bei mir sind sie Alle auf English und das ein wenig kompliziert.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you so much!! It works!####$$##%POSITIVE
Unlike page...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the quick response.####$$##%POSITIVE
Thanks for that. I've reported the website to your official website as you suggested. Unfortunately I now cannot afford to buy your product anymore.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Really?? So I'm just meant to guess what I am saying?? Whaat a joke.  Anyone had success with learning Manadain with this method?####$$##%NEGATIVE
They have an explanation for it that I don't agree with...but personally, I think either an English translation or access to a vocabulary list and some grammar reference would be a great help.They don't have to be obvious when learning, but at least accessed with the click of a button.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Oh, yes. You're supposed to guess, because they assume that everyone can learn a language just like a child does. Sorry, I'm an adult, I am smarter than a fifth grader.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Seems a little backwards to me.  There is more to learning a language than word association to a picture...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well it has been working for me. and I am an adult. sometimes you need to let go your preconceptions.####$$##%POSITIVE
It works for me. Sometimes, I don't understand when I first see the word but through their method of much repetition, I always get it. I realize that Cantonese is a hard language so I really can't comment on that. There have recently been some things that have happened to change RS that I don't like , but I really like their method. You learn without memorization and it is a very natural way to learn. I am studying French, Portuguese and Italian right now and I have achieved an intermediate level in all 3. So it works, no matter what Sean says.####$$##%POSITIVE
German. I have just had my first virtual classroom - it was great! Can't wait the next one.####$$##%POSITIVE
Seems like they are not interested unless you are sending them money. Thereafter it's bye bye birdie, we don't want to know you!####$$##%NEGATIVE
The course material is good at Rosetta Stone but limiting studio sessions does a disservice to the customers. Am looking forward to the update on my status from Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you VERY much. I have nothing against Rosetta Stone, but something needs done about facebook's activities. I appreciate your response.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I found that taking repeat studio sessions really helped me.####$$##%POSITIVE
Portuguese! Its a lovely language although my heart belongs to German!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have moved German as a top priority to learn- I have rediscovered my love for the language!####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a beautiful sounding language to me and there is something about it that grabs my attention! I want to go to Germany someday as well- I decided to learn German if I expect to be in their country. I mean, its respectful- and I really admire the Germans as well.####$$##%POSITIVE

don't think it's going to happen. it's a suggested page. like an advertisement.  it's probably going to stay there.####$$##%NEGATIVE
That confirms it for me then lol. They are stupid. No Australian contacts on this page nor Australian pricing. Thanks anyway. I'll change to Fluenz.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Wow that's a good deal####$$##%POSITIVE
The development they put into this is worth paying for.####$$##%POSITIVE

I bought Tagalog for the Philippines. It makes learning easy and fun.####$$##%POSITIVE
Exactly, considering that I was using the same I and II Rosettas over 13 years ago in school and nothing about them has been improved or changed to move from the 1980ish photos.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hell Yeah ! Do you're homework the price game they play ...less than honest marketing strategy at its worst !####$$##%NEGATIVE
This is  a BIG RIP OFF, called the 1-877 number because the language I picked only shows 3 levels and the guy tells me that my language is only a 3 level language which he can let me have for $319 but when I go to their website and hit a hyperlink that says Learn More it shows what you would learn in Levels 1 thru 5.####$$##%NEGATIVE
i would love to have german and spanish but way too expensive####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why is there never a great sale on Level 1-3 sets? If I can get a Chinese Level 1-5 set for $309, then why can't I get an Arabic Level 1-3 set for $199-$250? Or why don't you make an Arabic Level 1-5 set? I have been waiting for a promotion on the Arabic program for some time, but all of your promotions are for the Level 1-5 sets. Please consider having a comparable discount program for your Level 1-3 sets or complete the sets with a Level 4 & 5 so that they will be eligible for your promotions. Thanks!####$$##%NEGATIVE
God I wish I could afford it.. Lov different languages..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Crooks...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yay! Perfect with the 5 payments!!! Just can't do it til tomorrow :( hope it's still on sale. :(####$$##%POSITIVE
Got the Danish...but now they want more money to upgrade. ..crooks...####$$##%NEGATIVE
wish I could afford it!####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's a lot of money####$$##%NEGATIVE
I need to learn another language but won't pay $300 for it.....better luck next time####$$##%NEGATIVE
has anyone tried this Rosetta Stone Language course...?  It still sounds fairly expensive to me.  I wonder if we could find a used set much cheaper.  Think I will loooks around.####$$##%NEGATIVE
It's not expensive ...it's as good or Better than one on one live teacher .. Oh that's right it compares you to native speakers also ..  It's a great value even at full price####$$##%POSITIVE
Great product but too expensive. Rosetta stone needs to re-evaluate their pricing. So many people want this but can't afford it! Your company's losing millions of dollars in sales every year!####$$##%NEGATIVE
if you drop the price more people would buy and the more people buy the more money you would make.......#commonsense####$$##%NEGATIVE
2 semesters of any language is more expensive than this and you won't be speaking it .... The price for sale is excellent .,####$$##%POSITIVE
If you all think the product is expensive. Register for a college course in the same language. You'll pay 1000s more####$$##%POSITIVE
Still can't afford####$$##%NEGATIVE
Me gusta mucho este curso,,,, pero tambien que cambien la misma propaganda o commercial de Rosetta Stone en todos los canales de tv lo mismo y lo mismo por favor ya cambien eso que no hay mas????####$$##%POSITIVE
I've used the trial and Iove it. I still think the program is over priced.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Love U Rosetta Stone! U R Awesome! I already speak French but your Program is the Best Ever. When I retire & want to teach my self Italian, will U offer me this Special?????????? Oui ?####$$##%POSITIVE
Still to expensive####$$##%NEGATIVE
That's a rip off...I only paid $200 for mine...and I've only used it one time...####$$##%POSITIVE
It's a great program, how about having a sale around Christmas time!   :)####$$##%POSITIVE
5 pay sounds good!####$$##%POSITIVE
I have their Aribic version. Its horrible. Do not buy it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Not really somethin' I'd recommend. Did French language but it doesn't tell you correct grammar. In the first chapter, it says "le garçon ne pas du stylo" but it should be "n'ai pas."  I didn't like the program because I felt like it's not entirely correct####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks for the information. I'm looking for French if you know anyone. Since I no longer have an online subscription "My Account" only shows the prices for the online service. I can't see prices for the RS private sessions.  I spent over an hour on their website today trying to find the information.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Right?  When the hell are you going to say "The boy is under the ball"?!?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I looked thorough the course contents over the years and I cannot see how one can learn actual conversation in a language using this software. Yes one can learn vocabulary and some grammar and put together sentences....but where's the conversational needs? Studio sessions, yes. But what about the software itself? communication is more important than trying to learn random words and sentences (that style of teaching went out 25-30 years ago). The software should get a major overhaul to teach conversational skills from the start - not to mention cultural sensitivity in the pictures according to the region where the language is spoken.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Spanish (Latin America)! I'm going backpacking in Colombia this December and need to finish up my Spanish skills. I used your program here in college for a class and loved it, so I figured why not? :D####$$##%POSITIVE
We just tried that code and it worked!####$$##%POSITIVE
Wish this didn't cost so much####$$##%NEGATIVE
it does work!####$$##%POSITIVE
Go to the library and get Pimsleur.  MUCH better than super-crap Rosetta Stone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why do students have to pay for each different software package? why can't it be just one price for everything?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Most of my questions and messages get ignored also.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hi There, I haven't had a response yet since Sunday.  These discs were expensive and I would like to be able to use them.  Please can you advise asap - I have undertaken all the actions within the troubleshooters.####$$##%NEGATIVE
No, there is no message there.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I find it odd also that they close on the weekends.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thanks. I have not received your message yet. I now have additional problems and am working with support on Error 1141. The Program on my Mac will not open at all. I have followed suggestions including uninstalling and re installing to no avail. I leaving in 3 weeks and this program is crucial. Thanks Gregory Spring####$$##%NEGATIVE
well they get you because you have to first "like" them to unlike them and all your friends see that you "liked" them and so they get more likes from your friends that way to spam more people.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thank you but I just used that as an example. It is all levels. We are down to nothing for the next 2 weeks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, Bill, it is so unacceptable. It is a disgrace to charge us and not offer anything for what we are paying.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've tried deleting them and they don't go...refresh the page and they're right back.  And there is no opt out....facebook even says there is no opt out right in the instructions.  There is for ads at the side (which I have no problem with), there isn't for sponsored or suggested items right in our feeds.  Even if I could "block" you I would be happy...but I can't because Rosetta Stone isn't an account, it's a page.    I heard something similar from another vendor.  I think facebook people have lied to you about what we see.  Nothing personal...just taking a stand against this ridiculous move by facebook.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@RS - Pls respond.  Thx.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I find this interesting...A year and a half ago I was told by Rosetta Stone "It’s important to keep the majority of interactions on our Fan Page public, so that the whole community can benefit from conversations."  And yet the discussion between Dan, Janice and I here disappeared. I find literally thousands of complaints on here since RS first launched this page...why did this conversation, and others I've been involved in just quietly disappear...???? I'm just doing what I've been told.  I must be in the Twilight Zone.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Then have the website customer service working. You have to have something####$$##%NEGATIVE
Even still. Not selling is one thing. A company that large, and international, should have someone to speak with, whether online, or on the phone. Ridiculous####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes! Thanks so much for the great sale and the 5 payment plan!####$$##%POSITIVE
It comes up $349 when I click on the link####$$##%NEGATIVE
got Level 1 and 2, my computer died and I can't transfer it...now THAT SUCKS ROSETTA STONE.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Of course at this price the language I chose is not included!####$$##%NEGATIVE
This link does not work for, it just keep stating connecting and nothing else.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just tried again by clicking on link above and same msg, I give up.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I tried to guy this tonight. I would get to shipping and billing, default was free overnight shipping and kept getting an invalid shipping information message without any way to correct it without going back two screens. No hint as to what was wrong. I am actively trying to spend money. Please take it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've had nothing but problems: First with the socalled online "coach" and then with the service. Very disappointed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You guys realize this price is for all 5 levels of the language.  Look it up on their website.  If you took a language class at a college it would cost $300-$1000 just for one semester.  So you're basically getting 5 semesters worth of language lessons for only $309.  Look at it like that.  I don't know any tutor or college that would offer enough classes to be fluent in a language for $99 that you are demanding..  This really is a bargain and I plan on purchasing the French version for all 5 levels.####$$##%POSITIVE
Why does your site say up to $150 and here it says $190?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Does the online version in the summer program allow access to all of the languages? Normal online price is $129 for all levels but under the summer package it is $239?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I agree.  IT is still too expensive.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Maybe so, but you needed an elective class or required language class.  The program is awesome, but like all software way too expensive.  MS office is another way too expensive product..####$$##%NEGATIVE
Grammar is such an important part of learning a language. I don't see where Rosetta Stone accomplishes that. Maybe if you had accompanying workbooks, then the price - even the sale price - could be justified.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes, $324 for only a 3 level set....when I can get 5 level sets for $309 using this same promotion and even as low as $199 using a coupon code.  How is that rational?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm having trouble with the links for some reason, both in Safari and Firefox (http://bit.ly/17y6X1Y).  If I go directly to your website, I see the Summer Sale, but it's more expensive than the FB offer, which appears to be an additional $40 discount ($349 vs $309).    I see that the non FB sale has the TOTALe online access for $239, but because the FB link isn't working for me, I can tell if there's an additional discount for this product through FB.   Is there an additional discount for TOTALe through FB? If so, can you give me a direct link or some other approach to redeem the discount?####$$##%NEGATIVE
It would only help if it was 5 payments of $20.00!;) Thanks for the option though!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta Stone does not provide translations, so if you are a complete beginner, good luck figuring out the meaning of words by looking at the pictures.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Just got the Spanish (latin america) series. Thanks for the deal. I've been waiting on a good one to come along.####$$##%POSITIVE
I have to agree with Jasmin.  I'm a teacher, and would love to use Rosetta Stone to re-learn and brush up on spanish.  But, even with 5 payments, I can't afford it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Take your damn unsolicited advertisement off my Facebook page NOW####$$##%NEGATIVE
I dont think $300 is too much if it works.  Your stupid phone most likely cost more and the translator apps suck. I just got back from Japan and would have loved to be able to communicate.  I cant afford it but may just toss it on a credit card so I can learn before our next trip to Japan.####$$##%NEGATIVE
