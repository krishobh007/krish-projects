"Personally, I do not understand why they have to insist that no translation is needed to learn a language through them. Even Berlitz - the actual inventors of the ""Dynamic Immersion"" technique back in the 1880's use translations and explain grammar whenever needed in the student's native language. And to say that you learn as a child is an insult. We are not children AND a child's grammar or pronunciation is corrected when possible by an adult. Adults need rules to figure things out. Trying to notice and observe patterns and comparing them to pictures (especially when the sentence does not make sense in a real world setting) only leads to frustration and confusion. Dynamic Immersion as defined by Rosetta Stone’s understanding does not exist at all in this world. You can go everywhere and your native language is either understood or used. So you will find someone who will explain things to you and correct you when needed in your own language. I’ve experienced that many times in my travels to Europe I believe in giving the language materials to learn, and providing a translation to fall back on, and to explain the more intricate details of grammar where they are most confusing - especially the advanced stages of grammar."####$$##%NEGATIVE

"When do you expect that RS users will see some improvements in your online program now that you've merged with Live Mocha. The RS interface is really a clumsy, outdated point and click interface which doesn't take advantage of the tremendous strides made in e-learning. Seriously, a language learner cannot even look up a verb conjugation. God forbid you violate your complete immersion methodology. Modern language learning methodologies have moved way past complete immersion and have been scientifically proven to be far more effective. Change is only scary for a little while:)"####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Rosetta Stone! OK. I have a really frustrating issue. I have mentioned this before and my question was answered by some half man/computer generic response. I currently do not have internet connection(typing this on my iPhone) I have purchased my German 4 and 5 discs. HOWEVER, it will NOT let me install them due to it, ""requiring to download an update"" Let me emphasize the following point, Yes the first 3 cd's it allows me to update later. BUT for cd's 4 and 5 its like MANDATORY, I can NOT install them without updating! There is NO way around this. I have tried this several times, checked online forums and even asked this question before but whoever answered it. Clearly did not read the part where it said I cant update later. I own 4 other language packages with you guys, I am a big fan of your product and believer in its power. Is there ANY way I can install this without having to update it? I have the cds I don't have the option to update it, I just want to install it. Please HELP ME!! I couldn't be more repetitive in describing my issue, so I'd appreciate a real response and not some link to pacify me like you do for the others. Your loyal customer, Brandon Thanks!"####$$##%NEGATIVE

Perhaps he will, perhaps he is away today, I have no idea but I would like to hear from someone who will undertake to fix this today.

"VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Supposedly had ""unlimited"" access for studio sessions, but autorenew failed and now account - (which is mysteriously showing MY info on my screen, but agent claiming my father-in-law's info - he only purchased the software and that's it - is on their screen) is canceled, so I have to supposedly SIGN UP AGAIN - with my record of lessons back to BEGINNING - and I had to sit thru EIGHT agents as they passed me back and forth between Customer Care and Technical Support, only to be passed to #7 who would only spout her darn sales pitch THREE TIMES before signing off and switching me to #8 who told me that #7 shut down her station instead of setting up the new account and she said I had to listen to her SALES PITCH first before she'd do it (THREE TIMES, REMEMBER??!!!) and it turns out she didn't do it anyway, so now I have to call back tomorrow and go thru it all AGAIN, and #7 told me I probably won't have the ""unlimited"" access again because that was ""for a limited promotion only because of some darn survey"" THAT I SENT IN AND FOLLOWED UP VIA PHONE, and #7 claimed they never got it - then how the hell did I have the Unlimited access for the past 4 months???!!! And why is my account online showing that it's all set up for autopay with unlimited sessions, and the agent's account is so weirdly different? And if the autopay wasn't working for some reason, why just cancel the account without notifying the customer via email at least? This is so messed up! Definitely going to blog about this unless it's resolved without further wasting my time! Really??? It needs more than 8 agents and 90+minutes to get this done???!!!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"By and large, I had a great experience with RS. Some irritating bumps along the way but overall it was an excellent experience ... until recently that is. One day I scheduled about 8 private lessons in advance and now, when I have 3 of those left I cannot schedule anymore. The message I get is that I have ""you don't have any RS sessions available. check your subscription"". I certainly do have sessions left available and after a number of emails and 3 calls to Customer Service I was finally told that the problem is that I cannot schedule more than 2 in advance. Really? So why could I do it before and why does the automated message say something very different? I hope you answer and I hope you do not tell me to contact customer service"####$$##%NEGATIVE

"I am very frustrated with Rosetta Stone. I ordered a set and they have shipped to the wrong address. I specifically gave a separate shipping address when ordering and it was ignored. Further any attempt to contact some sort of customer service has failed, even the phone number will not work.

"The programme as suich is really good BUT: I'm totally disappointed with the support and service. The set up doesn't work well, I had to install and deinstall various times, the updates seem to kill the system. The helpdesk is nice but helpless... In addition, you cannot use your programme on a tablet. The price you pay for the most advanced programme doesn't include an upload your CDs to itunes, hence you cannot use the programme on your ipad (reason given by the helpdesk: its 1GB - so what?)... of course, you can purchase an additional online version :-) - but this only works, when you have an internet. How usefull is this???? So many hours on planes and travelling would just be perfect to study - but not with Rosetta Stone!!!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"hey Steve heres something to ponder.... it's the arrogance of an american company that says Canadien french is not worth the effort but yet thinks that 9 american english ) is a real dialect. we canadians know that the USA does not think much of us . you have proven that over the years , butthis little farce is so beyond stupid!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
Rosetta is a site for the owners benefit only.it does not offer standard Thai not to mentions my dialects . They offer the languages that are common and easy .This is not a good company . I would never buy Rosetta.####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Rosetta Stones' commercials targeting Spanish Speakers wanting to learn English (USA) are extremely offensive and racist. I am apalled that you would rely on stereotypes as marketing techniques.

I need help, I paid for something I am not able to use, which is not so pleasant...I need a soon answer"####$$##%NEGATIVE
I'm getting very frustrated with my software. After a year of not being able to use it - the updates support provided FINALLY worked! Now I'm getting back in to my studies and when it comes to speech it only recognizes my first 2 or 3 words. My microphone is registering on the 12345 test and I pronounce the words very well. I have tried to contact support and chat but when I click the link for live chat it doesn't redirect. Can someone here help me?! Should I have had language updates too?

"I've got a bug report for your ipad app. When you don't use the app for a while it's supposed to go back to the home page.

I did answer all the questions, it just didn't record them. Please let me know if you can forward this to your development team. I have a screenshot if you like."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have Rosetta Stone through American Public University. Is there any reason why I can't seem to log in through the smartphone apps?####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Rosetta Stone customer service is ridiculous. They couldn't resolve my problem and so told me to take it up with McAffee. At the end of the day, I figured out a work-around. If you get an error 5611 and RS tells you to remove your anti-virus and otherwise jump through hoop-after-hoop for them try this instead. Create a user account with a birth date under 18 years. You can't access the online services this way, but at least the program isn't rot on your computer or money out the door. I will not recommend RS to anyone. Although I enjoy going through the lessons with my son, it was not worth this aggravation."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Rosetta Stone has a great product but for the last six months has failed to deliver services as promised. Their foreign language curriculum is well balanced and can meet the needs of various learning styles. Their coaches are terrific and I always look forward to their sessions. Unfortunately for six months they have failed to correct their computer error which disallowed me to continue unlimited sessions as was due. Poor communication between departments and unfulfilled promises has left me angry and frustrated after initiating contact via phone, email and online chat a couple times each month. Each agent politely recognizes their error and yet nothing happens. The February email from the CEO was the biggest joke. How can he say that he was offering a ""gift"" of unlimited sessions when I should have had that all along?"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Just want to follow up that within the last few minutes RS has confirmed they have finally fixed the error.....but why six months? And any one who can offer any insider knowledge to resolving problems in a more timely manner would be most welcome. Also if anyone at RS can answer why throughout this whole process did every customer rep that answered the phone or online help was not informed of RS's policy that anyone with continuing membership prior to October 14, 2012 was not limited to a specific number of sessions? This was written online in small letters below the new policy of limited sessions."####$$##%NEGATIVE

I know that isn't your fault, but I returned it to Amazon. Just now I received an email from your sales department saying I just paid a lot of money for a new subscription. Please give me the contact phone for someone I can call to make sure my credit card hasn't been charged, and this is a mistake. I did not place another order.

I am now living in Japan as an exchange student and placed last in the placement test out of over 100 students, of which the other 99 have never used Rosetta Stone. (I asked each one) I also can't understand anyone here because nothing sounds anything like what they are saying on the software. In addition, your last commerical was very degrading to Japanese women as you guys imply that they are willing to run jump in bed with anything that comes along. Is your next commerical going to have a Jewish banker stealing money from his customers???? It is my goal to make sure nobody I know waste there money on this scam. There is more to language than a green checkmark and a ding. Its ok for vocabulary, but nobody will learn how to conversate on the fly in natural form."####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Could I please get some customer service that is actually HELPFUL? I can honestly say that I will NEVER recommend your product. I try really hard not to complain on Facebook, but this is absurd! I was told returning the product was quick and easy. So far, that has not been the case for me. I did a live chat for 45 minutes, and not only were the reps kind of rude, but they didn't help me. And before I could get the answers that I needed so I could go through the process of returning the product, they disconnected me! For someone who proclaims to have the best learning software and great customer service, the promise is completely under-delivered. All I want to do is be able to do what I was promised I could do (which would be return the software within six months). So far, no one at Rosetta Stone seems to be able to do this for me. I sincerely wish I would have never invested the time or money into your software. Maybe I just caught two reps on a bad day. But really - I just want you guys to help me out and allow me to return the product like you said I could do."####$$##%NEGATIVE

I’m very disappointed and fuming mad with Rosetta Stone and their Customer Service. I was put on hold for a bit over -1 hour and 15 minutes- and was just told via a recording that they are unable to process my call and to try again later. That sucks and your Customer Service Sucks!!

"also, the speak recognition does not work well - way too often it doesn't recognize what I said, and sometime a incorrect sound seems to score perfectly."####$$##%NEGATIVE
is there anyway to skip the dynamic im mersion. The technique does not work for me at all. I'd like to learn the proper prounouciation in a methodological way. The immersion session gets boring and frustrating rather fast. Thank you.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Just wanted to mention that I am not going to be purchasing TOTALe after my trial is up if you guys don't start allowing for more than two studio sessions a month. 2 a month makes the sessions worthless.####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Please change this cap you put on the studio sessions per month. 2 studio sessions is unacceptable, seeing as this program is all about immersion. That is the best thing about the program. For the price of rosetta stone, we should get unlimited studio sessions. I love the program, but will not purchase anything else from you guys if thats how you want to play. Thank you for your time, and have happy holidays."####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Well, if it's going to happen to anyone, it's going to happen to me. I bought a brand-new, never-opened copy of Rosetta Stone French 1-5 on eBay. It contains a headset (the same brand that is in packages I've seen in retail stores) and an activation card that I had to scratch off a coating in order to get the activation code, as well as the eight CDs that make up the program and accompanying audio for comprehension training. It was sealed with special tape that has Rosetta Stone's ""cut it and you own it"" policy printed on it. Rosetta Stone won't honor the purchase because it wasn't from an ""authorized"" dealer. The package was way too sophisticated to be a fake. Since it's not a fake, they've already made their money by having been paid a wholesale price for it. And, on top of it all, they asked for my help by providing their legal department with help in prosecuting the seller. During the vetting process, I provided them with my receipt, pictures of the package and of the activation card. They basically told me ""sorry you lost your money."" Don't buy from them. And if you have, be prepared for their sterling care and concern. That's all I have to say."####$$##%NEGATIVE

"just tried the Chinese (mandarin) Rosetta Stone. it is by far the worst program i have ever used. no english translations means i have no idea what im saying especially since the pictures are inconsistent in the subjects they represent. i have no idea how im supposed to structure my sentences and it kept using words without specifically representing them with pictures. pinyin was NOT explained how am i supposed to learn a non latin based language, with no instruction on sentence structure, punctuation, explanation of cultural values, or idea of what EXACTLY im saying."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I love the studio session and just signed up again via Visa. I did not realize it was only for 2 sessions a month. I feel deceived and am very disappointed. I did not see this anywhere when renewing. Too bad. I was able to do studio every week before.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Thank you for your input. I finally got through to someone in the US this afternoon that was able to help me work through a couple of problems and he gave me some guidance on the others. I will spend some time working on those later. It is unfortunate that I have to work so hard just to get the program to do what it is suppose to do. We'll see how it goes. Thanks again.####$$##%NEGATIVE
What is 2123 Error ?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have to say I am APPALLED by your organisation. I bought a spanish language product online two years ago and was using it until I got cut off from your server recently. I do not blame you for the fraudulent product but I rang your organisation when I got the product and got its verification code authorized by your organisation. Your organisation is a DISGRACE and SHOULD BE ASHAMED of itself for its poor database and its unwillingness to resolve problems in a fair and honest manner.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I just tried to see the demo of your Software and simply will not work regardless what I use e.g. email or facebook.. not very promising!.. can you let me know how to access a demo as your website is not working thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Customer service yesterday was remarkably unhelpful.####$$##%NEGATIVE
" I was really saddened when I saw that the limit was 2 per month. And as each session is only 25 minutes, it really doesn't make it worth your while."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"For a SAAS based company, your system's are slow! I tried to reset my password using the ""forgot password"" button."####$$##%NEGATIVE
" I understand it may be hard to believe, but some of us dont have internet connection (like a grandparent or kids computer) and that makes it awful tough, if not impossible"####$$##%NEGATIVE
it makes me so upset if its real....####$$##%NEGATIVE
"It now started to not recognize my microphone and keeps crashing whenever I try to set it and moreover now started giving me the error notice 2125 (for the 3rd time). Rosetta, peeelllleeaaase, this is outrageous, your software is faulty!!! HELP."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Disappointed that you have cut the time of LIVE speaking to 25 minutes and only a couple sessions! Since that is the best way to learn a language....Practice, practice. practice. A complete negative for Rosetta!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
I cannot get a structured class based on what I have learned with RS through any other source but RS. Taking it away devalues RS.####$$##%NEGATIVE
"OK........ so are these sessions the ""classes"" that I have to schedule, Billy Ray Mainer? I don't understand any of it. I'm very annoyed and frustrated."####$$##%NEGATIVE

I am having horrible technical problems. I have internet and install the program with cds.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I would NEVER buy anything from this company after how they treat a great friend of mine. Be leery of this company cause they are CHEATS!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have used Rosetta for sometime with good success. However Houston we now have a problem! The session time has been cut to 25 minutes. Now I have been told I am allowed only 2 sessions per month !! I am not satisfied. Not the same Rosetta I signed up with !!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have called and called. Maybe the more complaints will help.....####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Yes, I am shocked to find out that it is only the people in the USA who have an individual program who have been limited to the 2 sessions a month. We pay the same money for the program as those abroad, don't we? Is this something punitive for us for some reason. Very odd way to do business."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I saved for the Homeschool version of Latin American Spanish, and am still paying it off. It is WAY too expensive for what it doesn't do- stay installed on Windows 7. I am constantly having to call the 1-800 number and go online to ""chat"" with the Indian techs (whom I assume are in India and not in the US) to get the thing to work after the update then reinstall."####$$##%NEGATIVE
Customer Service is NON EXISTENT ... You pay $500 for their language program and when it stops working properly they're answer is to upgrade to their new version for another $500!!!!! Be warned people!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
they may be great but I do not like their business practices####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I have to admit that the technique the software uses is really good, but the software itself is messed up"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"The tablet is far more conventient, it is what I use when traveling. But now I am shut off from Rosetta Stone unless I am at home in front of my computer. How totally stupid and unfair."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Simy - I have had great experience with Studio sessions also as a learner (French). However, Rosetta Stone has changed the Studio policy and online users can only do Studio sessions twice per month now! Not good."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Two days after installing it and using it successfully, my Rosetta Stone stopped working. I did a live chat with customer support, who told me that my product wasn't authorized and that I should return it for a refund. Worst product/customer service ever!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"The program I received (as a gift) was in the box and fully wrapped in plastic, the same as it would be from any ""authorized"" retailer; if you can't simply tell me how to fix a flaw in YOUR software, then your customer service is as terrible as your software."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Though I really disliked when a RS rep would post a canned message regarding studio, I think I prefer it to the complete radio silence we're getting."####$$##%NEGATIVE
Im very upset no one will respond online or on the website####$$##%NEGATIVE
"It's awfully restrictive and, unfortunately, I fear that RS have cut their noses off to spite their faces with this one. RS is a fantastic product, which I believe in dearly, but my loyalty to the company is disappearing. Fast."####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Is there a future for the studio sessions? They got cut in half in length, limited to 2 a month and it seems to be getting more and more difficult to find them."####$$##%NEGATIVE
is the glitch in the typing section being addressed. It won't let you insert the curser to correct or alterantely to press the delete to back up . you are forced to enter and get it wrong.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Stop the awful music and especially the loud base.####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Some Times in rosetta stone doesn't recignize that I pronouce the word exactly the same as the recording, a defect in the software?"####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am taking French and lately I've been having issues getting to my lesson. I believe its the result of my flash player updating? Has this been fixed yet?####$$##%NEGATIVE
What Rosetta Stone sales people FAIL to tell you is that you have to activate their products within 6 months. Its not until you get through all the packaging that you see this small print. Complete waste of money.####$$##%NEGATIVE
"There is no way that I could ever recommend that anyone purchase this product and use it online. Time and time again I can't get the headset to work right and yes, I have updated the flash player. It didn't help. I have worked with the Customer service and it didn't help. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I hate it!!!!"####$$##%NEGATIVE

"I'm on chat right now. NOT at all happy to be told that to have spent several hundred dollars on something, I needed to pay more to talk to tech support. :( But hopefully we'll get this resolved."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Guys, your Latin is very bad. you have to do smth about it. The pronunciation is terrible."####$$##%NEGATIVE

"every time I log in, my microphone is not reconized"####$$##%NEGATIVE
1. My microphone doesn’t works erratically and is getting worse where I will say something and nothings is recorded. 2. I’ve gotten a “loading next screen” message that freezes and I have to close the program and go back in.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why has Totale Studio HD having sounds problems? I have tried twice to do studio session on my iPad and both times I've been unable to finish studio due to sound issues.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am finding it confusing how to respond to different tasks - for example - had to call in to ask how to enter the written responses. Wish you had a preview to the overall format!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Sadly i will never use this program or support Rosetta Stone. The customer service has been horrible when trying to transfer the program to my laptop.

"by the end of your ""proven"" method course you know how to say the man is being pushed in an apple not to helpful unles I see a man being pushed in an aple you seriously need to look into making your course less expensive I just unliked it"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I am upset about this too. I live in Canada. I was going to take advantage of this TODAY but I need the payment plan. Anyway, the search continues."####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yeah. that was a total bust and completely ineffective. I spent 30 minutes waiting to find that out! Thanks####$$##%NEGATIVE
"i am so disgusted that the American owned rosetta stone has several dialects of spanish and portuguese , they even have their own version of english yes thats right ( american english ) . but for canada there is no version of canadien french . i have been told it is not worth the effort .......... . we are told to learn Parisian. why if the united states has their own version of english where is our other official language. i ask everyone to voice a complaint to rosetta stone of this over sight and ask they treat us ( CDN ) as they claim for themselves with thier own special version of the englisj language ."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Then to add insult to injury the customer rep informed me that I must purchase -separate- service for each language. I'm studying two. So if I want to study both languages using my iPad for say 6 months, it will cost me $150 up front. That is absurd. I know that these people have to make a profit but I paid over $1000 dollars for these two courses."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Okay so 3 hours and counting. Now your website says the download of updates failed. If I can't get this working tomorrow, I will try to stop payment on Paypal."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Good day I would like to buy your product ROSETTA STONE TOTALe, BUT 1-800-925-0335 in mexico and SALES CONSULTANT not speak Spanish! That is a drawback of requiring information! I could help?"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I just pester me because I can not in my price pure. it means I did not have the authority to do so. the telephone customer service is not operated at night and the e-mails have not been answered. the rosetta stone system I think is great, but the customer service lousy."####$$##%NEGATIVE
DO NOT BUY!! Rossetta Stone has gone public and needs revenue. I spent over $1000 on this product for three separate languages and they REFUSE to give me support!! They did something to the software to prevent it from running on my computers and now DEMAND I pay them to help me!!!!! LUDICROUS!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Your company is actually losing languages not adding new ones. It looks like the company took a quick buck strategy and failed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
this is the lamest product ever. all it ever wants is more time and more updates and more programs and changes to my computer. if you are really so great at language learning then you should get me another copy that works or my money back. and i will advertise to all i know to never purchase rosetta stone unless you make ammends to my wasted money and lack of new language skill that you so proudly boast.####$$##%NEGATIVE

"I hate to beef about something I love so much, but I have to admit I hate and dread the writing lessons. It takes me forever to finish them because if I get one letter wrong, I have to repeat the entire page all over again. Perhaps that's not a big deal for learning Spanish or French, but for languages with different alphabets, like Hebrew, it's very difficult and time consuming to repeat it again and again in order to get 100% on the lesson. I wish there was a better system for correcting mistakes besides starting an entire page over from the beginning. Other than that, I love my Rosetta Stone Hebrew course and hope to learn another language, like Spanish, one day too."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am not happy with Rosetta Stone. I re-arranged my day to attend a studio session and it did not happen. The instructions provided did not work and there was no response to help request - a poor show!####$$##%NEGATIVE
The app has stopped working. Please fix it####$$##%NEGATIVE
BEWARE!!! Even if the RS system declares it works with MAC 10.3 or higher it does NOT work because OSX applications are NOT SUPPORTED by MAC. This problem needs to be rectified by RS by either a patch or by refunding the cost of RS to MAC users! BEWARE!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

"Tried another Studio Session tonight, but unlike the earlier one today, this one was a total fail. Finally gave up after 20 minutes of being distracted by the echo, tech support asking me questions (and asking me to test my speed, which was fine) and then the instructor cutting out. Disappointing, especially since my online subscription expires soon and good luck finding another session that meets my schedule before it expires. Don't know why it's so hard to schedule sessions when there were only two of us on tonights session and 3 of us on the earlier one today."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have had nothing but problems trying to install this wretched program on my laptop.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why when I call for support on installing my Spanish/Latin American 1&2 Rosetta Stone customer service refuses to help me unless I pay more money? They try to up sell me on some program that would bill me MONTHLY. I realize it is just over a year old but they should assist in a successful install. After spending so much money I just want it installed correctly without damaging it. Is that too much to ask for?####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I just opened up my wife's gift to me (French Levels 1-5) and got through the install and all the CDs are SPANISH not FRENCH. This seems like a huge manufacturering issue, as the box clearly says FRENCH as foes the Activation card. Now I've been ON HOLD for 15 minutes."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I've only had Rosetta Stone for about a month and my headphones are already malfunctioning. The left earphone is all scratchy. Do you have any sort of replacement warranty for the headphones?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why did Rosetta Stone stop allowing students to chat after a lesson? It helped many of us review the lesson and discuss vocabulary. Not cool.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have a problem with this pronunciation and speak exercises ...

I have a problem that I hope has a quick resolution. I've installed RS Japanese on 2 computers. Now my main computer has decided to stop working. Actually the hard drive is fried. I still want to do studio sessions but that option is only on the computer with the fried hard drive. Is there a way that the second computer can become the primary? I haven't been doing studio lately because my internet is too slow but that will be updated tomorrow.####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Upon starting the program (Spanish LA) last week, it advised about un upgrade (patch 4.1.10). I took quite a while to install. After upgrading, the program did not start anymore. Had to return to previous Windows Restore Point. I am using W7. Who has a clue what could have happened?"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Wow...your customer support reminds me of the old days. When the cable and phone companies were the monopoly. I have wasted over 45 minutes already of my very valuable time. Told I was being transferred to product support only to end up having the opportunity to give my name to several of your employees whom are all ""not"" in product support. Sad...I really thought the world of this product. Now all I want is my very valuable money back."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I am very much enjoying Rosetta Stone German, except for the grammar portion. When we get the answer wrong, the lack of explanation as to why it's wrong leaves me struggling and guessing. Really improving my vocabulary with this product, but it's lacking as an overall learning tool. I still feel like I'll have to take an instructor led language class if I want to truly grasp the language...which is what I was hoping to avoid by purchasing this quite expensive product. I'd give it a B grade ov"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I just bought the three-month on-line access to Spanish. I was delighted with my progress for the first three days. RS is a fantastic way of learning a language! HOWEVER. Today, my fourth day, I logged on and was dismayed to find an on-line access that was excruciatingly slow. I have a VERY fast connection and I know that a few pictures and a few seconds of audio take an instant to load. Instead I had to wait for a minute or two for each panel. It is IMPOSSIBLE to continue like this. I hope i"####$$##%NEGATIVE

"One of the worst products ever. This program doesn't make sense to me. It just ""threw"" me under the bus. Disc 1 seems to be a bunch of pictures and words.....WHY!? I have no explanation to questions, no lessons in grammar, NOTHING. Why is it ""Un Sandwitch"" but ""Una Manzana""? Why is the program saying a word and expecting me to know what picture it is when it hasn't taught me the word!? What is the point!? WHAT IS GOING ON!? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LEARN!!??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOMEONE PLEASE H"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I have spent hours upon hours trying to set up Version 3 on my Mac OS X. If you don't have a hard drive, this is a very long and exhausting process! You first must borrow a computer with a hard drive followed by hours of tech support. I am working on day 3 now. So, buyer beware. Rosetta Stone may do language very well, but not IT."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"RUSSIAN GRAMMAR HELP!!!!! I've looked up things online, but I just don't get it!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"How many of you out there have burned yourself out, or run into that ""wall?"" I know that I dove straight into Russian, and now only two levels later, I've got that feeling of ""Man...I don't know if I can keep going."" How have any of you gotten past that feeling?"####$$##%NEGATIVE

"A question for those that are studying Arabic. After the vowel marks begin to disappear, how are we supposed to determine the correct consonant when the writing exercises display more than one of the same? There doesn't seem to be a way to activate sound, and the other alternative seems to be just guess."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Gilberto, it might be good for traveling as a tourist, but the Rosetta Stone Japanese, for the most part, is very inaccurate according to native speakers. It might seem to have served you well, but Japanese people generally won't criticize a foreigners use of their language."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Anyone have a negative experience with the studio session? I had a negative experience with the studio session, and I am reluctant to do another one."####$$##%NEGATIVE
Could someone help me by telling me how to increase the text size in Version 3? It is really hurting my eyes and there is no option in the menu I could find.####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Remember me asking about resetting a Level to undo all the checks? And RS answered that I would have to make a new user? Well, I did, and I used a Swedish name and Rosetta Stone sent me an email to CHANGE MY NAME because it is too hard/unfamiliar! A SWEDISH NAME...which I will using for the SWEDISH STUDIO!"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"I understand there is an issue with the mobile app since upgrading to iOS5. The app keeps crashing/not opening. Help! What are you doing to fix this, Rosetta Stone?"####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Having been away for 2 months, I thought I would get back on-line with Rosetta Stone Turkish...but looks like a no-go. Not being terribly computer smart, I uploaded some updates of rosetta stone and now all I get is ""Fatal Application Error #1141....any explanations??? otherwise, I cut my losses and hit the books.....not terribly happy bout this...."####$$##%NEGATIVE
"This program is an epic failure with tech support. Every session is a disaster. I can hear them but they cannot hear me. I am wired, there are no other programs open, my cell phone is not near the computer, the speeds are good per RS, the headset is configured properly. I can use Skype and Google+, just not RS Sessions. I am so angry with this program."####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was playing Contrasto and my partner had selected Identi. We had some audio issues so that might be why she disappeared. It's not so easy to find partners to play with but I'll keep trying. Like studio sessions half the battle is to not be afraid.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am being prompted for updates but when I try to load the updates it freezes the program. I have worked with tech support for a few weeks and the issue was never resloved. Is this going to be an issue on info i need to know for sessions for studio or am I ok without the updates?####$$##%NEGATIVE
On one studio session someone came on Level Unit 2 Studio Session that was way above that and it made it really hard for the rest of us and was really intimidating. Is there anyway for the coach to limit that?####$$##%NEGATIVE

I've been on hold for over 20 min trying to upgrade (give you more money). I love everything about this program except the customer service. Your customer service makes me cry every time:(####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have been trying to upgrade from Version 3 of Rosetta Stone to Version 4. I had hoped to take advantage of the new on-line features. So far it has been an exercise in frustration. I have spent HOURS on the phone waiting for help from customer support. If the experience I have had with Version 3 was as bad as the experience I am having with Version 4 I never would have purchased Version 4. What is going on with you guys? You need to get your crap together.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I paid $800 for Rosetta Stone almost two years ago. I saw it the other day for $350. When I called to add the TOTALe they charged me $100 dollars after I have already invested $800. I feel like you should upgrade for free for the people who paid over twice the price for the software to begin with. I think charging me the $100 was pretty rotten. :0(####$$##%NEGATIVE
"Rosetta Stone is a great tool. However, when learning and educating comes only at a cost... kinda defeats the purpose. People yearn to learn and experience new cultures, but times are hard; learning should never cost as a luxury."####$$##%NEGATIVE

Please PLEASE PLEASE! Let people know who are new to Rosetta Stone how to properly set up their RS headset for Studio. Tech support does not listen when I tell them to check the other students. My tech support constant interruption was annoying and distracting. I just received an email from the individual thanking me for allowing him to help me. He didn't help me and I didn't ask for his help. I did pass this on to customer service.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I tried learning rosetta stone but the french version started calling me a retard. Or retart or something. Anywho I'm stuck####$$##%NEGATIVE
"One of my biggest regrets on learning a new language was buying Rosetta Stone but not because of the software. Please, please if you bring out a new version change the activation system.

"Today, after 3 years of using your product to learn mandarin chinese, i finished levels 1-5 after doing the last milestone. I have Rosetta stone to thank, for actually unlocking my language ability, and have to admit this is the most amazing way to learn a language if you dont have the means to travel to the country. No other language program out there gives you real life situations, as rosetta stone does, which i think is really cool. After 3 years of using this great product, my favourite units were arts and acedemics, shoppping, and proffessions and hobbies. Also, my favourite milestone was unit 2 level 5, where a couple goes to a movie theater and tries to decide on a movie, very neat. Anyways, xie xie ni, for unlocking my language talent and bobbie.",####$$##%POSITIVE

Rosetta is an excellent source of articulating a different language..it rocks!,####$$##%POSITIVE
"Sean, It works almost subconsciously. For some time I was pretty skeptical on the dynamic immersion process (they should still offer a translator for clarification though) however I noticed I was answering questions correctly and I did not understand how I did this. It works in an insidious way. So it works for sure, just not in the way you'd expect it. Ps. Adults who are immersed in a different country learn that language faster due to being full immersed in said environment. Dynamic immersion is the most efficient way by far!",####$$##%POSITIVE
The Totale website is super cool and fun- it is a lot better than my (college required) foreign language classes. I love the games.,####$$##%POSITIVE

"I just started on French (on lesson 2 of level 1) and I must say I am amazed at the content (to my surprise). Wow! I will have fun with this! I also have all levels of Spanish, and I was wondering if it is a bad idea to work on both at the same time. What do you recommend? My background: Portuguese/Brazil - first, English - second, Spanish - third (higher intermediate) and French - fourth (basic). Thanks.",####$$##%POSITIVE
"May peace be upon you guys, You guys have done an excellent job, providing us with facilities to learn new language. I truly admire and like your work.

"I love to use Rosetta Stone and as a teacher for English as a Second Language, I think that Rosetta Stone will give you a great boost in learning another language as painlessly as possible.

This is the best investment of my life. I'm about to change my life for the better.,####$$##%POSITIVE
"Compared to the amount you would pay for tutors and books, rearranging your schedule to attend classes, gas to drive to school, etc., this program is very reasonably priced. I've studied 7 languages (in a formal setting) since 1986, and this program is by far the most interactive and conducive to learning. I didn't buy the program expecting to become a convert; I'm an old-school rote learner and expected to not like it. But I'm totally sold.",####$$##%POSITIVE

"Your Italian coaches are just delightful!! I love them all. They each have a fantastic teaching style to contribute to our progress, and as we advance the conversations are so enjoyable. The only drawback is, you don't seem to allow us to make friends with coaches (as in, email correspondence etc). They are such socially skilled and congenial people bursting with the flavor of ITALY and it would be such a jewel to actually become friends with one!",####$$##%POSITIVE
Thank you Edward. The bottom line is seeing constant progress is the ultimate motivator. It is so powerful it's almost intoxicating ! And that feeling of confidence and positive achievement carriers over into many other aspects of your life! Cheers !,####$$##%POSITIVE
I'm making good progress with english...Thank you!,####$$##%POSITIVE
"I just completed my third week of Brazilian Portuguese. Folks, it works! Having been a language instructor for more than 40 years, I can attest to the efficaciousness of the Rosetta Stone language programs.",166####$$##%POSITIVE
"I just finished a studio session with Thomas (Deutsch) and I must say he was the best studio instructor I have ever had. He was a lot of fun, and our group couldn't stop laughing because we were having so much fun! It was a very laid back atmosphere, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I am currently Deutsch Level 2 Until 2, and had just finished Level 2 until 1 studio and noticed that level 1 unit 2 had an open session that started in five minutes. I was nervous to take it because I hadn't reviewed this section in over a month but decided to give it a shot. I was surprised at how much I remembered, and how the words just came out. I didn't even have to think for example - table is tisch... It was just tisch. Such an amazing experience. Again Thank you Thomas!!!",####$$##%POSITIVE
"Good Irish studio session tonight; Maureen is a very supportive coach. I was the only participant once again, but it's great getting a private lesson.",####$$##%POSITIVE

"Hi. About a week ago (or so) I posted having big time trouble getting Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 to load onto Windows 7. There *is* a compatibility issue, but it can be overcome easily by running the installation as the administrator, or running it in windows XP compatibility mode. The laptop I was trying to install it on to begin with was a ""lower end"" model, so to speak. I upgraded to a much better machine and it is running VERY smoothly. Thank you Rosetta Stone for trying to help. I'm sure they",####$$##%POSITIVE
A very successful French gamenight on this end. I've really been able to tell a difference in how comfortable I feel speaking the language. It's been a great experience so far. Anyone one else feel like you're starting to get more comfortable with your new language?,####$$##%POSITIVE
Attended my TOTALe Social webinar this evening. Very informative! I really <3 Rosetta Stone! =) Thank you so much for making learning fun and intuitive!,####$$##%POSITIVE

"I love the Rosetta Stone Adventure.It's challenging,yet rewarding.",####$$##%POSITIVE
Silke is wonderful! (She was the German teacher for the Studio I just did!) She is very animated and fun!,####$$##%POSITIVE
Danke für mein <> mit Angela. She worked hard for the whole hour ... I think that it must be a challenge for a native speaker to listen and help three disparate foreigners struggle with basic language skills.... she made us feel good about our work.,####$$##%POSITIVE
"I'm ""totale"" obsessed with Hebrew Lvl 3! Thanks guys!",####$$##%POSITIVE
"The more languages you learn the easier it becomes.I am really fascinated by the magic of language learning and by the fact that it expands my horizon. ''Those who know nothing of foreign languages, knows nothing of their own''(Johann Wolfgang von Goethe )",####$$##%POSITIVE

"In addition to what Francine said: You can't do the writing activities; just the speaking activities (and you can read what you're going to say.) So that, combined with the Audio Companion, is pretty useful and handy if you're away from your computer.",####$$##%POSITIVE
"I'm learning spanish, I think my coach's name was Harold...he was very nice and supportive.",####$$##%POSITIVE
"Great explanation, thankyou!",####$$##%POSITIVE

"That would be lovely; I also just sent another email to email help, it is ref # 14006-2271619. Thanks!",####$$##%POSITIVE
"OK, I did my first on-line session. This stuff is terrific!! The new version that runs on the iPad and the games really takes learning up a notch. Having the studio session takes it over and above. Strongly recommned Rosetta stone if you want to learn a language.",####$$##%POSITIVE
"I agree. I think the sessions are the funnest part. I love it when I'm reading a book, watching a movie or even playing a game and recognize the words used because of a lesson. It's happened in Pokemon and in a Japanese horror movie.",####$$##%POSITIVE
"I took Spanish during the same time in school, but didn't take any college courses. I started RS Spanish the other day. I'm zipping through the lessons as I remember quite a bit. A good refresher before getting to the higher levels. ",####$$##%POSITIVE
"That's a very hard question to answer. I like getting different perspectives while learning a language so I have A LOT of different programs. Rosetta Stone is addicting, and fun. While waiting for lunch today I was on the android app. I love Rosetta World. My favorite game is Buzz Bingo. I got to try Meta Tag yesterday but didn't know how to change the keyboard from phonetic to true Russian so it was very slow going. Any ideas on that? I do like how it tracks your progress and won't let you play a game above your skill level. I wish I could play them on the android too (hint hint) I also love how it makes you speak and think rather than a passive learning where you can become lazy and just listen. And it teaches how to read along with speaking. Breaking down words is used in other programs but seeing it broken down along with hearing it that way makes it so much easier. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to listen, it's still difficult to tell some letters apart. Sorry I babbled there's just way too much I like about this program I don't have a favorite.",####$$##%POSITIVE
wow! its breathtaking!   ,####$$##%POSITIVE
"I totally agree with Charie. Also, learning a language really does take time; Rosetta Stone is by far faster than most ways, but it still takes time. just keep goin'. You'll get to a point where you'll see paterns and when the level 1 stuff puts you to sleep! (thats a good thing)",####$$##%POSITIVE
I'M OFFICIALLY HALF-WAY DONE WITH MY ROSETTA STONE JAPANESE! It's an addicting program and I'm learning much Japanese. I've surprised many Japanese people when I speak to them. I'm loving the program so much that I want to pick up another language once I'm completely done with taking the Rosetta Stone Japanese. :-) ,####$$##%POSITIVE
"To anybody on the fence, jump on over and get this software....It's much more of an experience than it is a learning tool...It's worth every dime....!   ",####$$##%POSITIVE
this is the single greatest thing i have ever experienced ,####$$##%POSITIVE
Rosetta Stone - pretty much the best ever!!! ,####$$##%POSITIVE
German!!!!! Very quick and easy learning. Thanks!!!,####$$##%POSITIVE
Learning Italiano. Yes. You got me hooked and Spanish is my primary. It's a feast except when I get error message. It not frequent but I still love it. ,####$$##%POSITIVE
I was stationed in Panama from October 1989-July 1991 and by immersing myself in the culture through friends and their Panamanian spouses I was able to learn a basic form of Spanish that would allow me to fully appreciate and learn about the Latin American culture. It has also given me a great basis as I continue my study of Spanish with Rosetta Stone. ,####$$##%POSITIVE
"As I progress in Rosetta Course, the lessons are becoming more interesting.  ",####$$##%POSITIVE
HI! Received my Russian 1-3 today! I love it and cant wait to be able to speak Russian!! Also your customer service was great called and got all the help i needed with setting up my PC and not messing up my desktop with V3 of French home school..Thanks again!! :D,####$$##%POSITIVE
