Who cares whether their Airtel lines r terminated or not? Your services r VERY poor. I thought Airtel is the biggest brand if u consider their operations in other countries. Your technicians r always sleeping on the job.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Its okay. I receive 3 promotion sms & automated calls daily. I av contacted customer care twice n nothing was done. Am tired of deleting them daily. Infact I dont read them.  Make a provision for customers who dont want adverts. U r violating my rights.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel. You are turning out to be fraudsters. You come up with a FAKE competition in the name of data promotion. What\'s this MBMegaDash twitter challenge? Ever since it started, you\'ve been announcing winners of data, modems and routers but none of them has received any of those winnings. All you keep doing is telling them that they will be contacted by your team. That, coming from you is so lame. It\'s high time you start acting professional and stop the monkey business.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Airtek network the worst in mumias yet its a holiday####$$##%NEGATIVE
Airtel stop turnishing our country code in the name of 254.. this promo has done more harm than gud. 1shilling is deducted automaticaly on every top up ..i have been patient now lets see who will get the last laugh.so far you have chopped my 12bob now i owe you 200 minus 12=whose laughing now :-)####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your 3G network is superb, hope this will be sustained. More geeez to your elbow.####$$##%POSITIVE
When i joined Airtel i thot it was better, only to realize its worse.... Airtime is deducted from my account without any service n when i subscribe to data bundles.....i get feedback after eight hrs. Im stil lookin for an option, nahama####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ilove ur services,,. msa hakuna mshindi wa shinda karo..zawadisha old wateja..####$$##%POSITIVE
I work in maralal and 40% of time your network is unavailable especially when it rains, the worst is that your 2G internet connection is usually down.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Your network has been quite crappy this season,sms bundles were taking forever to be processed same as internet bundles,am always losing credit even when i do not use my line then your bundles get used up even before you can type Jack Robinson then you deduct airtime,reception has been on and off.It is rather frustrating yet I have been singing your praises if portability is still on I think I shall port to Yu or Orange.####$$##%NEGATIVE
u r good in delivering services but u got have so many problems sms are not going thru bundles are taking century to be activated.check it out####$$##%NEGATIVE
Have you not double deducted me  for a single buddle and delayed for hours before activating yet you are still deducting my credit?\r\nProve me wrong if i am.\r\nNo need for inbox!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Sapil...ndo maana niliwacha kutumia Airtel coz whenever I topped up after some time even without making any call ma balance would read zero if I inquired frm them wanasema I bought bundles na hata cjui vile huwa zanunuliwa. When I got fed up I left tht line dormant.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Woke up morning of 28th only to find #1000 airtime gone from my phone over night without making a call. Meanwhile for 4-5months now I have not been able to send out an sms. It says Network out of Order have called customer care times without no,sent mail and still nothing has been done. This has been my only network for 11yrs now,but i strongly believe I can\'t work with airtel in 2013 unless my airtime is returned.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Happy new year airtel, bt unfortunately i agree with the others about your offers. I won a coupon at nakumatt saying i\'ll get 5 tyms the amount of credit i bought. It never came. I reported thrice about it. If you don\'t mean to honestly grant your consumers whatever they win, why put up these fake offers and disappoint them? Hope Airtel wil b more honest in 2013.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Keep it up airtel.####$$##%POSITIVE
why u blocked my account ,i was trying.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Good Morning Mutinta, i would like to agree with Mitch\'s first comment, if airtel rounds off to 2 decimal places then it would mean us customers losing out in terms of monetary value e.g if i have Kr1.2340 (K 1234) and you round it off it would come to Kr1.23 meaning we lose that kr0.0040 (k 4). And for clarity\'s sake the example you gave is not so clear because if you have K3920, it should display as Kr 3.9200 and not KR 0.3920 as you put it. hope this helps. for me its fine.####$$##%NEGATIVE
y r u stil advertising the same promo wen u stopt it?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I called the customer care today, required how much it costs replacing a simcard, i was told its k5,000...That is K5 in rebased currency...\r\n\nEventhough Sesheke has no service providers outlet, it has customer licenced dealers. \r\nit was these same dealers that i approached, barely an hour ago, refused to do the replacement for me... Saying replacement costs K10, 000... that is k10 in the new currency... \r\n\nAIRTEL, if you read, this comfirm it to me that these dealers in Sesheke are employed to increase the cost of servîces... reach me on 0975 422715####$$##%NEGATIVE
I wish u cud just refund me my air time but I know I\'ll be just wasting my time. Remember u just reaped where u did not sow k5 is a lot of money to me.####$$##%NEGATIVE
U suck without promo, hurry b4 we leave!####$$##%NEGATIVE

@TwoHours Nig. D same tin hapened 2 me. I called customa care, d stupid girl da picked my call told me tins like dat hapen, can u imagine, I was really pissed. Airtel give me my money or I\'ll rain curse on u####$$##%NEGATIVE
Well for one, i\'m always deducted a shilling everyday(*124#) apparently i was subscribed without my knowledge and the most interesting thing is you cannot unsubscribe and i don\'t even understand why because the promises are never delivered. Calling rates . On top of that, you dont give much information when you change you rates for example the amounts so as one to attain bonus and then there\'s the issue of club 10 one subscribes yet they don\'t get the hour they are supposed to. So the question is why should we use these services yet we are not getting value?####$$##%NEGATIVE
I\'ve tried severally to get my modem data balance but I\'ve not been able. What is the problem?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Was there any prior notice to effect that? I have been loyal for almost 5 years but even after termination rates were reduced u increased.####$$##%NEGATIVE
this ntw sucks####$$##%NEGATIVE
i understand that YOU hiked call rates but YOU dint see the need to let US know????####$$##%NEGATIVE
May they (airtel Kenya) reduce sms cost,theirs is the highest in Kenya!!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Airtel Kenya, no offence but your response is interestingly \'unhelpful\'. Of course if Koech knew the code, he wouldn\'t ask that question. @ Koech, that is an international line (starting with 00 which is an international prefix code/international access code/international exit code) and the number is for Papua New Guinea, whose country code is 675...hope that helps...beware of strange texts being sent around from such less heard of countries..####$$##%NEGATIVE
ur data bundles sucks,if u subscribe it takes more dan 3 hrs 2 get a msg n yet u using da available credo work on dat,####$$##%NEGATIVE
Still disappointed.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thise guyz are just fake,i bought a modem from them and since monday still waiting for 4gb data and apart from that they rufused to activate it!fake crap!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why Airtel claims that the speed of internet is throttled to 512 kbps when it is evident that it is at 256 kbps. Could they at least be honest about it? I have unlimited for one month and in the last week I have always been below 256 kbps (except for 2 hours a day when it reaches 70 KB, so given or taken that is 512 kbps - BUT ONLY 2 HOURS a DAY, not the whole time).\nI\'m always on 3G. Whatever they say, my line has slowed down to 256 or below for the full last week. I wrote you already so many times but the speed is still the same, despite they claim is 512 kbps. (NOT TRUE!) Airtel, you should be honest enough to tell the truth that now you cap at 256 kbps.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am on the edge of losing my patience with you too despite 9yrs with your services.Especially thz two numbers 301 and 0787339304.I am a doctor and sometimes its very irritating to get those calls and texts in the middle of a critical procedures with my patients####$$##%NEGATIVE
hence the airtel numbers are forgotten....Very annoying!advertising is compulsory for all lines? I think Airtel should style up and stop these more than 3 texts/calls per day! And subscribing us to things we don\'t want.....####$$##%NEGATIVE
I had to laugh when I got Sunday morning texts from Zantel saying if I wanted to confess to a Mullah over the phone to call x number followed by another message 2 minutes later telling me if I wanted to confess to a priest to call another number. Clearly they felt I had something I needed to get off my chest!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Fraud Airtel is killing my business\nI was on a BB plan of N2800 for 3months( promo), i discovered i could not browse so i tried to load N3000 but i got a message that the plan was still on and the N3000 got exhausted.\ni went to the office on Oba akran and was told to send deactivated to 440 to stop the plan. I did this and loaded another N3000 and sent Bismonth to 440.\ni checked the balance it was N0:00 and i got an sms that it was successfully.\nA message ticket ID ANG000053081569;  \nticket ID ANG000053340463\nwas sent that the issue has been resolved but it was not resolved since December 27th.\nThe system is down thats all your customer service keep saying, call back in 2hrs.\nI have called more than 30 times. Visited your Ikeja office 5 times.\nPlease return my N3000 or activate my BB internet.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Nawapongeza sana Airtel kwa kuwafanya Watanzania wengi wanaocheza mchezo huu kuwa Mamilionea. Ukweli hata shamba lako kama huweki mbolea ya kutosha kwenye mazao uliyopanda huwezi kupata mavuno bora.Kucheza kwako kwa wingi ndiko kutakuwezesha kuibuka mshindi.Big up Airtel kwa kutufanya busy kwa kujibu maswali ambayo mengi yanaelemisha mbali ya kuwafanya watu mamilionea.####$$##%POSITIVE

Experience: Please, I have the worst reception of the network between 7pm and 10pm as though I stay in Kashikishi when im just in Marshlands. You call your bundles unlimited Internet, the service is equally pathetic. I would like to think you people never planned for growth in your customer base. Im sure every Airtel subscriber out there feels the same. Improve is not a better term, please better your services cause some of us are tired, I have written to the post in the editorial comments about your services####$$##%NEGATIVE
I was just crying over the same.....but for me I reacht er target not for e minutes bt for bundles but nothing!!!! BS wats wrong with u pipo?####$$##%NEGATIVE
@Temweka its getting out of hand you know.\r\n@Paula ask them, though I doubt they\'ll answer smh. Its not funny I tell you.\r\n@Esther well, you accumulate free minutes when you reach your daily target(which depends on your usage) then after giving you those free minutes(so they call them) you have to spend about k2 or so for every second you call which is by far too ridiculous.####$$##%NEGATIVE

@Airtel is mega x a promotion 4 u or customers coz seriously I really dnt enjoy it coz my target was raised to 15pin or k15 and yesterday when I used my other sim whch has a target of 5pin I was only given bundles,no minutes or smses.

If i\'d known i wudn hav joind. My target is KR20 by the time tht finishes i wud hav talkd to whoever n the 23hr K2/sec wud hav started. Ur promos are to win customers over not get complaints every minute. Its rather pathetic if u ask me####$$##%NEGATIVE
Airtel i would appreciate if u stopped calling me its very irritatn if i wanna talk to u, il call u. Like pliz am dead seriouly, it really gets on me.

Am talkn on behave of alot of airtel subscribers who this happens to. So not fair.####$$##%NEGATIVE

The best you can do is to stop your promotions because they are very stressing mwandi. Leave it for others.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel mega 5x is a pathetic idea of stealing from customers you guys are working on things that are only beneficial to your salaries and company you don\'t consider people and there needs, now I have noticed airtel is not here to make life better but to eat money that\'s all, it was going to be better if you guys eat money while providing quality and standard services rather than eat peoples money and yet provide pathetic services####$$##%NEGATIVE
Taken note...but my network has gone for about two(2) hours now. Am in Mbala####$$##%NEGATIVE

it is a flop. there is no Benefit at all. we have no option but to go green. after all it is our network. great job Zamtel.####$$##%NEGATIVE
The previous promo was better, the problem with this one is that you have to reach a target in order to receive discounts-but, the daily target is quite high as well.####$$##%NEGATIVE
How do u come up with your targets,i personally can not meet my target.lack of a better term,you are really exploiting me.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Jugmeet Markanda thanks for taking the initiative.I m facing the same sort of problem my blackberry services are activated and the pack balance was deducted at the time of activation.inspite of all this my balance keeps on deducting and when i call their customer they give me rubbish excuse that \'\' sir your balance is getting deducted because you are using airtel gprs\'\' and when i ask them how come i am getting charged again when the internet pack has already been deducted he fails to get this point.Hey you,Airtel guys it\'s not about money all the time  it\'s about your impression which is getting tarnished every day.And the way you treat your customers is completely ridiculous.even i could have raised this issue but i got de-spirited by seeing your behaviour but kudos to jugmeet we all stand by you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I called on your 121 care and conveyed that charges are getting deducted. I was never told to restart the handset I was told that it\'ll is activated after 1hour and if you used that before that\'s why the charges are deducted. Whereas the message I get is that within 1 hour it will be activated and till I got the conformation that its activated my data for phone was off. Your rep told me you can\'t read message and blaming on us. I\'m not that dumb, if thats what are trying to convey. \nAnd they said the charges won\'t get deducted now but the same thing happened again. \nWHY I CALLED YOU GUYS FOR THIS. I WANTED IT TO BE RECTIFIED NOT CARRY ON LIKE THE SAME\nAnd what about the services that you activate without consent. What is the explaination for that.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I totally agree. I am almost tears everyday because of ridiculous call tariffs. Buying airtel airtime everyday is so stressing.  Its so so so so unfair to customers!! Big shame####$$##%NEGATIVE
U r just  fake in terms of internet matters upgrade ur systems ama u remain at the bottom in the internet service providers####$$##%NEGATIVE

The key to life is to break things down into simple understandable components, so that everyone is CLEAR about what is going on. The structure of this new promotion (MEGA X), from the comments I see on this page and from my experience, is intended to mislead your customers - SIMPLE, or in other words Airtel is trying to be smart which is tricky when you are dealing with a service people have PAID for. To simplify it further, in two words, DAYLIGHT THEFT.... That\'s why I keep two lines and I am voting with my hard earned cash! In my considered opinion, Airtel is getting way to greedy and I think it\'s time ZICTA stepped in. I intend to lodge a complaint with ZICTA concerning your voice service so called \"promotion\" and your UNLIMITED (4gb unlimited for 1 week) data bundles, which simply take our money but does not deliver what you contractually promise. The fact that the Government of The Republic of Zambia allows you to operate in a semi Monopoly does not give you the right to RIP people OFF!! I have read your monotonous reply to those that have complained before me and I find it UNACCEPTABLE. Kindly, do not try that with me!####$$##%NEGATIVE
10 sims is more than one! i askd so bcuz when i get a sim ..and i hav issues wit it.. custmer kr has never been useful so wat i resort to is i stop using it and gets a new one...####$$##%NEGATIVE
Am unable to get my bundles even after reaching the target####$$##%NEGATIVE
No you have not. The background I have been given shows that you charged me from my main account during offpeak, even if you agree that I had reward minutes. Emma even gave me the amounts I was charged. And how come you cannot tell what time I first called Airtel on Friday, is it because you are worried that will prove to you there was actually a problem on your side? I thought calls are recorded.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hehe lol they better answer you.... These guys r tryn....imwe.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Am not enjoying this promotion, I called your call centre during the weekend but the person I talked too didn\'t give me straight answers pertaining the same.\r\nOkay, assuming my daily target is KR15.0 & I manage to reach that target & it so happens that thats the only money I have, that means I cannot use my reward points; coz I can only use them when there is something in my account at a rate of K2 per sec if am not mistaken. My point is, if I have no extra money in my account then I wont use my rewards, so where is the benefit there?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Its not about th discounted rate. Its about how sumtyms 1s talk time disappears evn if 1 knows thy stil had airtime. Its like you guys are cheating yo way so th@ we reach th ridiculously exagerated limits wen it seems th@ a person cant reach th set limit. U dont care about your customers n are violating consumer rights! This promotion is a sham and is very unreliable and unstable!its not genuine. And i hope people realise this and move to a different netwrk bcoz so far nothing is being done!####$$##%NEGATIVE
It happened consecutively fo 2days...my limit was KR8. I had KR10 in my acount,i remember sendn a few text mesages i ddnt mek any calls only to recv a msg sayn i had reached th mega watevr. My toktym was gone. I cald th customer care line bt ther was no respons. The follown day i recharged and th same thing hapend.i ddnt bother calling customer care. I just hoped th@ it wd not repeat itslf o God so help me id have gone to make a scene @ th airtel offices. i was robed of my money,which is hard to come by. Ryt now my limit is higher and iv never managed to reach it. So wats the point of it all?  Bottom line is i would like to not be part of this promotion. Is there or is there not a way?####$$##%NEGATIVE

I remember there was a time I waited for close to an hour. my goodness. And you net work has been pretty bad at times where you send those number is now available sms. After being on your net work for over 10 years im pretty disappointed and really getting fed up. Please improve.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I always experience troubles whenever i purchase bundles for ksh 100 and above, i gues its because of the free nights offers because after the 7days i dont experince such. My net goes down completely after 10pm for the whole night...its realy inconviencing me its better you charge me, i dont mind.####$$##%NEGATIVE
You are lucky you are complaining about that. What annoys me is when Airtel keeps calling through 301 or any other number to promote one service or the other. They drive me to the wall.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am not able to make calls####$$##%NEGATIVE

Ogunbode you are right. Thats why i dont load credit on my airtel lines again. Until airtel stops that useless and unnecessary football alert sms and the rest. To me thats cheating and stealing. The moment u recharge ur line before u know airtel will be automatically drawing d money until they deduct ur last kobo. Thats  too bad...####$$##%NEGATIVE

I am pissed off by their income generating activity which they are calling it mpikisano...... Sakupereka ndalama ayi koma makasitomala akuberedwa ma K50 pa sms. If 500 000 can send only 1 sms per day Airtel makes around K25, 000, 000 a day and in seven days they make K175, 000, 000. Airtel then gives out close to K4, 000, 000 as prizes.\r\nThis money does not come from Airtel but the same customers who are crying because of the financial crisis our country is going through.\r\nThese kind of companies should not be allowed to do their business in a country such as ours. They rip off  the poor customers they country has.\r\nI am planning to throw away their sim card which i bought in february 2007. I am fed up with this gambling. I hate them very much and i have even stopped calling using their poor line.\r\nNext time you try to send your irritating smses you will hear from my lawyer. \r\nI cant stand this nonsence####$$##%NEGATIVE
The only help i need now is to get my service restored since Friday 18th January my service has being off \n1st I called the customer line and i was told to wait for 24 hours and will get service back\nafter 24 hours no service \nI called again and i was told to wait for 48 hours and is a general network problem\nMonday i went to your office in Kaneshie after hours of standing outside cos the place is too small and more customers are in already ,\nthe lady told me to wait 2 hours and it will be done cos she has solve the same problem a couple of hours ago which after 2 hours i still dont have service\nyesterday I went there and am told the lady did not forward through the right channel therefore at the end of the day she will forward a complain and will be solve \n\nas i write this comment i still dont have service .\nwhat have i done to get this kind of treatment from airtel?\nHow do i feel free as your slogan says when i dont have service ?\n\nthis is number which is associated with the problem \n0242306429\ni hope to get a quick respond soon\n\nthanks####$$##%NEGATIVE

Oh my God!Airtel,this is what i constantly tell u: \"i hate to hear your outfit being spoken abusively of\". U find it difficult sometime to heed to advise. This man is serious furious,so exasperated indeed.  U really need to act decisively on this matter. Ur customer service personnel are a pale shadow of themselves,totally naive on current issues surrounding the company. They need to be equipped and constantly fed with reliable info. Airtel Ghana i love your company and im proud to be part of the family. Just listen and apply the counsel i give u. Pls####$$##%NEGATIVE

you are advertising \"one network\" no roaming charges but you are cheating and charging for roaming on receiving and making calls and sms from \"one network\" countries, calling your costumer care they don\'t have an answer but keep charging? also you harassing customers with sms of chances to win money or prizes I never agreed to receive this \"junk\" sms moreover when I\'m on roaming and get charged for receiving that####$$##%NEGATIVE
Thnx for yo answer. It is actually much more prefferable that u cut me off than switching me to the unfair plan which is unreasonably expensive. U guys shd do like MTN. We dont even know how to check for usage and do u expect me to keep checking usage? Plz plz plz change. You didnt explain why yo net is annoyingly slow at times in addition to always bringing up dat google thing with a tool cartoon showing repairs...####$$##%NEGATIVE

This is one thing i hate about airtel. They are always quick to respond to comments intended to hail them and ignore those ones that tend to challenge them. In my opinion,the challenging comments should rather be your priority to address and not those which arent challenging. Its not a good practice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
pls do. we are very much agitated. the problem has lingered for too long now. we beg u. send us our cash prizes we won in the airtel top up and win promo####$$##%NEGATIVE

Merci a vs. Mais arretez de miroiter des mirages aux clients. La semaine passée vs ne cessez de me balancer ce fameux sms ki m\'invitent à consommer un certain montant pour benéficier d\'un certain nombre de secondes de communication. Ce montant dépassé k neni! Cette semaine aussi ça reprend. Arrêtez svp ne prenez pas vos clients pour des gens à gruger à tout moment. De tel sms indesirables à mes yeux ne doivent plus m\'etre envoyé. Vivement merci.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Just around kamwala south basic school in Lusaka, I\'m using a Samsung galaxy s3 (GT-I9300). It\'s not like I can\'t connect, the problem is everytime I\'m around here the connect type symbol on the top of my phone changes to \'E\' which I believe stands for ordinary packet data instead of maintaining the symbol \'3G\'. Once that happens accessing the internet takes so much time because the speed drops to about 113bytes per second. But everytime I leave home for town the speeds stabilizes and gets fast just as I reach kabwata and I get the \'3G\' symbol again. My contact is 0979293440, this is not a joke.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Asante kwa nyinyi kunijari. Namba yangu ni 0684209554. Jina Renatus Kamara, nilijisajiri mtwara kwa kitambulisho namba 14900 na nimetumiwa fedha kutoka kwa edson kamara. Tatizo ni mimi kutoweza kutoa fedha na mwanzo wakala alinambia nisitumie namba 1234 na kubadili hila sikufanikiwa.  niliwajuza kwa kuongea na muhudumu wenu akanambia nisitumie 0,1,2 kama kianzio katika pin na wala kutumia mwaka au namba za kufatana kama pin na hivyo kubadili kutumia 8160 ila bado mkataka niongee na nyinyi. Kila nilipo fanya hivyo HAMJAPOKEA na ni mara kwa mara. Kwa juhudi za wakala kutaka walau nipate pesa. Aliweka kla uwezo na mwisho pin ikawa 8719 na bado mkagoma. SASA KUNA JIBU PINI SIO SAHIHI NA MIMI SINA LA KUFANYA TENA.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Pauline, why saying fake airtel? Know that airtel started officially its activities in Rwanda at the end of march last year. So, comparing with other telecomunication companies when they have spent one year operating in Rwanda, airtel is developing rapidly. Dutegereze turebe ibyo iduhishiye. Ikindi kandi tuge dushigikira ko habaho concurence (competition) ku no ku isoko rya za services kuko bigirira umumaro twebwe abaconsumers naho monopole nimbi cyane kuko tubihomberamo.####$$##%POSITIVE

im ok for now.....2 weeks ago i had issues with money disappearing from my lines....iv been using these 3 lines for over 8 years now and i think i know how much credit i use.....i called your customer care agent and i was just given so many explanations...and yet i know that i put 250ksh credit made 3 or 4 short calls and the next thing i know is im account empty...and this happened 3 or 4 times in a span on of 2 weeks....iv only had such an occurence with airtel once before that was early last year and i was compensated....which i highly appreciated....because its not about 250ksh which is a small sum....its about you being in a situation where you think you have credit and your barred from making calls....this happened to me on 2 of my lines\n\n2nd problem- i call people off late and the network is so crappy....sometimes they cant hear me sometimes i cant hear them....\n\n3rd problem- i try to check my balance....it keeps saying service error\n\n4th- this free credit thing...my phone tells me \'\'spend another Y amount and you will recieve X amount bonus credit\'\' now supposing i have 100ksh and i spent 65ksh i get an X amount of extra credit which is valid until midnight.......the extra credit is what should be used....but what happens is that until my remaining 35ksh hasnt been used up the bonus wont work\n\nanyways for now my issues seem to have resolved themselves...my credit usage is back to normal....only current issue is that i cant check my balance it keeps saying service error####$$##%NEGATIVE

Oui mais voilà, cela fait une semaine que je n\'arrive pas a avoir la connexion, en pleine ville à Antsirabe! Malgré mes réclamations et des promesses que l\'on va faire \"le nécessaire\" en une semaine! SVP! Les techniciens d\'Airtel sont incapables de rétablir la connexion sur 3G75, alors pourquoi faire de la pub pour inciter les gens à acheter le X230 machin! Heureusement qu\'il y a Telma et Orange! Vive la concurence!####$$##%NEGATIVE
got wrongly deducted, made the complain and after7 days customer service calls me and say it was system error so we should share the cost. What kind of customer care will suggest to strike a deal like that. Nobody seems to know where the problem is from, are you kidding me.####$$##%NEGATIVE

OK. They said: Airtel Sierra Leone is a THIEF. What did you say? See what others are saying. Subscribers to the Airtel Mobile network have expressed dissatisfaction over the way they are cutting their credit for the ringing back tune. According to them, airtel is subscribing them to the ringing back tune without their consent pointing out that they are normally cutting their credits monthly. Some people claimed that airtel cuts 12 units every week. They described the company as thieves who have no vision to help their subscribers. They called on the National Tele Communications to tell the airtel mobile company to stop giving them music\nWhen I called the customer center number which is 111, one of their agents denied the allegation and stressed that they always ask people to subscribe by calling them or telling them to press star symbol on their phones (*). The customer care agent pointed out that they also have promotions such as super 10, crediting from the company if your top up is finished among others that are beneficial to their subscribers.\nWhen he was contacted, the Moyamba and Bonthe districts superintendent National Tele Communications Ahmid Kannah admitted that they have also noticed it pointing out that they have told all mobile companies to stop all promotions at as this time. He registered the National Tele Communications’ commitment in ensuring they cub all the irregularities in the communications and ensure all subscribers enjoy communication in Sierra Leone.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Really.  if i have won a prize, send the 1000 mbs to my phone bana.  i don\'t need crappy advices Story. \r\n\ni can advice kenyans not to participate in airtel promos .they are all a fraud and fake.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Ahsanteni. Ila nadhani mpango wenu wa 0.10/sek. unaumiza kwa wale wanaoongea dakika 2 au 3 maana kwa zile dak 2 za mwanzo mnakata hela nyingi sana, inakuwa na manufaa kwa wale tu wanaotaka kulonga kwa muda mrefu na wenye credit ya kutosha. Basi wazingatieni na wale wateja wenu wanaotafuta walau kaseti kidogo kuwasiliana wawezeshaji wao ktk shida. Pia ule ujumbe wa sh. 125 ni unyonyaji kwa wale wanaotuma ujumbe mmoja tu kwa sik bila kurekebisha hilo wateja wengi watadrop away. Wakumbukeni maskini wa Tanzania na tujenge Tanzania bora kwa pamoja, otherwise good job.####$$##%NEGATIVE

When was this changed? I feel very poorly treated as a customer by Airtel. I renewed my internet bundle exactly as I have done in the past. There is no indication that anything has changed, except then name. The price is the same, but when I check my balance I notice that it is now limited to 7GB. Why am I not informed about that when I make the purchase? I would like I refund, could you please arrange that?####$$##%NEGATIVE
my number is 0733931226 i load credit a few minutes later i have no credit as in really####$$##%NEGATIVE

And do you know your systems are down most times and takes days, weeks and even months to get back again????? For almost a month: *111#, *544#, *180#....has not been working. keep showing \'session expired\'. Are you aware? See you guys just shut down, improve your services and or products, even if its one service, make it reliable, then reopen. Airtel is soooo irritating and painfully disappointing. gosh! Customer service=less than average; data= less than average; voice= average; network= average; cost= good....But do you know its better to pay more and get a Reliable deal? ITS NOT JUST THE COST. maybe one day, you will wake up, hope it wont be too late.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like airtel BUT Airtel CareLess about her customers and the services offered.......####$$##%NEGATIVE

same here,used it for 2 hrs and then here it is upload 14.03 and download 0.00,airtel please educate your customer care agents.one agent tells me that the 1 day unlimited has issues which they are trying the best to resolve(last night) and this morning a she agents tells me that my internet bundle is over,does she know that the customer is always right,i have been using this service since the zain era####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel Kenya What I actually meant is that the above number keeps on calling me with annoying unsolicited adverts. I was thinking of blocking it completely. Is it one of your official numbers?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Yes simon airtel should stop this..its very annoying####$$##%NEGATIVE
I called customer care and was told that the unlimited bundle was under the EZ blaze menu.\r\nI then selected as per the instructions only to download 500mb and it just disconnected.

I have been in contact with u guyz for the past 4 days complaining about my unlimited. I have called u guyz for more than 50 times n u feed me the same story,what i dnt understand is y am i buying the unlimited bundles n they work for only 10 min??? I have spent so far shs 600 hoping that u will sort me out as soon as your \'technical team\' are done repairing the problem just like the way u told me.. Y do u do this as right now nimenunua bundles na hata nimemshow mtu wa duka venye nimesubscribe for that unlimited offer.. This is not fair @ all... If there is a change in your services,u should inform your customers about it even if its too hard/xpensive for you to advertise in the media/social networks(thats y u have a fan page for crying out loud)@least inform them when they call your customba care.. Never been this dissapointed in my life,yes u have the fastest modem bt your services are just pathetic. Such a sad excuse of a company... @least other networks charge a bit expensive for their services bt in the end its worth it. Truly cheap is expensive,u change ur subscription charges overnight without xplaining or advertising to your \'esteemed\' customers... #verypissedofcustomer...####$$##%NEGATIVE
hii ni kuyap tu. Ur customer care standards are terrible. Ata subscription to net huwezi hapa eldy####$$##%NEGATIVE
why increase price for  bundles without informing your customers .that\'s totally bad and unprofessional.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Your data is fast indeed, I get download speeds of up to 1mbps on my mobile which is fairly good but... today I purchased EZ blaze for 199 hoping to use it the whole day but it only lasted about half hour and I could no longer connect! All my airtime was gone too. I thought I had not purchased at 1st but then after checking on my data counter, it registered 750mb, I believe you cant download that amount of data unless you are using some bundle... so tell me, what happened, why was I disconnect before the contractual period was over??####$$##%NEGATIVE

since the entry of blaze my internet connection through simcard line 0788545495 has been very slow and erratic.

I want to reload credit on my phone but please, promise me that your company won\'t deduct one shilling as usual. your calls and text messages from 155,306,888, kopa credo (which I hardly do), NAKUMATT,+2547377930177,+254787339304, other ringtone offers are quite a nuisance and unsolicited. They fill my text messages inbox by the end of each day and I think you deduct my money because it is your source of income for financing these unsolicited text messages. AIRTEL Kenya....oooh...boring service provider.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Don\'t even care about ur cheap promos. Get ur network working. I can\'t even dare subscribe to any of ur internet package. Guess I\'ll switch once and for all.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have so much to detest about airtel these days and that is why I chose never to recharge my call unit again. I permenently switched off the phone because it does not worth the stress. Amazing thing is that airtel nigeria advertised customer care email does not work.111 call line is rarely picked so why keeping the patronage when its obvious customers\' problem is never their concern but to remove recharged airtime value without notice or owner using it. I am victim of this and I do not know about you.####$$##%NEGATIVE
A wanderfull........@ 9ja people####$$##%POSITIVE
Endlessly I\'ve used every medium provided by airtel to express my displeasure. Yet, customer care seem not to be their priority. I think I\'m better off with ma new network. At least I\'m browsing efficiently on their 3G network without delays. And they don\'t deduct money from my credit like airtel is addicted to. Airtel, you are not worth the stress.####$$##%NEGATIVE
@mike Ɣ☺ΰ are very right dats what they do,ĀѪ also α̅ victim.they keep sending some useless(repeatative)sms every blessed minutes.well its not their fault,had it been we have α̅ functioning and responsible governtment,they wouldn\'t have go this far by deducting money from account without using it.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Airtel when u resolve Ibeto\'s issue, what abt d others who airtel has been unfair to one way or d other. Cos as for me I\'ve lost track or how much airtime unit airtel has unjustly deducted and my subscription to browse gets expired befor d supposed date. To mention but a few. There are others who has pressin problems wit airtel. U guys should improve on ur services jor cos presently, airtel sucks. Thank God i\'ve other network services to use.####$$##%NEGATIVE

The business atmosphere in Nigeria and unscrupulous behaviour of some vandals is causing these network providers sleepless night and also they must make return on their investment.\r\nThey will pay their staff, govt officials will ask for their share.\r\n\nIt is not their fault\r\ncorruption and inconducive business environment are the variables that do not allow them to serve their customers better.\r\n\nBut still when you talk of dat service, Airtel is the best####$$##%POSITIVE

Exactly, nobody was complaining... but they do everything for their clients!!! ha-ha-ha... Since they became Airtel they became very bad!                                                                                             I was a postpaid client for 7 years, than they wanted me to receive the invoices on my email (so that I can spend money 1st: on connecting to the internet; 2nd: on cartridges and paper; 3rd to do their secretary and print their invoice! And I am allowed to pay it too!!! And to be postpaid I had to pay 280Ksh. So I decided to get regular pre-paid customer and use the 280Ksh for the phone calls.                                                                                                                                             No one at Airtel couldn\'t me explain what is the benefit to be on post-paid...####$$##%NEGATIVE

Kindly inform your legal department to carefully study the Constitution of Kenya and the Consumer Protection Act. Your actions in respect of \" Unlimited Internet\" will surely lead to a court case. An apology would at least suffice.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I am sorry Airtel Kenya this does not actually serve the public better as they are not receiving \"unlimited\" internet. So now not only is your customer care appalling but your new service is worse than before.####$$##%NEGATIVE

No longer using airtel\'s internet too...i min airtel you should know better than chase your customers from the only service that got you your popularity...please return the old rates before you lose all your worthy customers.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I also purchase the unlimited bundle last week for office use and only learnt today that the reason i have not had internet is because I have overused the unlimited bundle.  Upon enquiry at the Nakuru customer care they then informed me that the unlimited bundle has been discontinued.  The issue is why not issue a notice to the public so that our hard earned money is not just consumed at someones whim.  This is totally unacceptable.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I must thank Airtel for your response to my previous request concerning internet service at Igbeti in Oyo State. But when the service was restored, instead of upgrade from EDGE to 3G you people downgraded our internet service to GPRS. This is totally a step backward and the service is now sympathetically sluggish in connection. Pls as a matter urgency do something. I love airtel. From Igbeti,Oyo State. Thanks.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel kenya, the point of concern is on the internet services especially in marakwet if you can rely the poster, then at the consumption of the internet bundles it sometimes reaches an extend that your remaining bundles is 16mb for example but later when you ask later it reads nothing. Byee! Airtel we love.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I will leave this network sababu mnaniibia daily bila huduma yoyote.  Mnaaanza taratibu, then mtaniibia yote. Nimechoka airtel, nipo humu since celtel hadi leo inaitwa airtel. Achaneni ujinga hii ni hela yangu, nimeiweka kwa malengo ya mawasiliano. Hii ni mara ya mwisho ikiindelea natulia zangu vodacom, wa hamko pekeenu.

Mimi naona kama mumeharibu kabisa hili shindano la Amka Milionea. Hizi points za bonasi za kazi gani?. Kama washiriki wanakuwa nje ya mtandao wa Airtel anaporudi sehemu zenye mtandao si anaendelea na points zake alizokuwa nazo. Offer ya point 450,000 za kazi gani. Rudisheni mfumo wa mwanzo mnachanganya wachezaji. Unachelewa kujibu message kwa ajili ya ubize unashangaa umetumiwa ingine na bonasi huo sasa sio ushindani wa points ni uharibifu.Nawashauri watu waendelee kucheza ila ondoeni hizo points za Bonasi hazilete maana ya shindano kabisa.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel, why are you guys bent on defrauding me. I subscribed to BSM N1,200,  on 7/4/2013 around 7pm, though the reply I got was \"Service Temporarily Unavailable\", the money was taken and the data bundle never given. I called the Customer Care (CC) line (111) severally without success, when i finally got through around 5pm today 8/4/2013, The CC representative i spoke with logged my complaints after verifying my claims and told me the issue will be resolved in an hour. But as of the time of posting this(10:28pm), nothing has been done.\nMy line is 08081722156. Please restore my money, N1,200 or credit my line with the data bundle of 1GB and 1month validity which I subscribed for. For the records, this is the second time this thing is happening to me. The first time, I called and lodged my complaints with your CC representatives whenever I get through for 2 weeks and nothing happened, but this time I want  my money or the bundle I subscribed restored.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Bado ninatatizwa na kitu kimoja. Matangazo yenu ya 3.75g yanaonesha kuwa inapatikana  Tanzania nzima. Lakini kumbe ni mijini tu! Kwa upandf wangu hii ni kero kubwa sana kwangu, bundles za vijijini na mijini ni zilezile lakini speed inatofautiana. Ni kero kero kero kero hadi kero. Ingekuwa vizuri basi mngekuwa wazi hata kwenye matangazo yenu, kuwa huduma hii ipo mijini tu. Hebu fanyeji juhudi basi huduma hii ipatikane Popote pale mtandao wenu unapopatika, ili tujue kuwa KWELI YATOSHA. Huku nilipo ninatumia EDGE network, very slow, slow, slow, hadi inakuwa slow. Natambua hata aina ya kompyuta inaweza kuchangia, lakini ninapokuwa mjini, huwa nafurahia sana network ya 3g. Chondechonde Airtel, yatosha sasa huku vijijini kutumia EDGE, HEBU SASA TUKUMBUKENI NA SISI TUANZE KUTUMIA HSPA.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel has no functional customer care number. Functions today goes off for the rest the year.\r\nThat\'s why you disturb ur subscribers wt programmed calls and also keep enticing them to call 141. A programmed rubotic response that has no solution to one\'s problem. I WAS proud of Airtel.####$$##%NEGATIVE

You are trying. But you need to be real and stop unnecessary deduction. For example, I was ask to pay N700 for N200-welcome back of my stolen sim and N500 airtime. Surprisingly, Airtel yet deduct N200 from N500 airtime and worst of all the SIM swap work for some minutes and thereafter my device started telling me \'Insert Sim Card\'.\r\nPls be doing this swapping snappy  of course you know I missed lots of important contacts and messages for more than 5 days.\r\nPlease return my N200 back and N100 subscribed for What\'sApp before my phone was stolen.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Airtel u re thieves. U deduct money for no just reason. I ll not recharge again thank God i have more than one network that i am using so u cannot cheat me. Thank God for that.####$$##%NEGATIVE

c as a mata of fact,ur charges ar jst morethan ur service,so do smtin about dat okey?...####$$##%NEGATIVE
The more promotions, the more confusion, the more easy is cheating people that cannot keep up with the many rules ... and the easier is to take their money out without giving any new service. These are some \"PROMOTIONS\" Airtel has done lately: \nBefore we paid 3 shillings per minute to call, suddenly \"NEW OFFER = YOU WILL PAY ONLY 6 cents per second!\" That makes 3.6 shillings or 20% increase.\nBefore the SMS where 1 shilling, suddenly \"NEW OFFER = ONLY 2 SHILLINGS for SMS\" (That is 100% increase).\nBefore we could browse and download Unlimited for one month easily between 100 and 200GB in one month, Suddenly \"NEW OFFER = Now you will get 7GB. to browse for one month and be BLAZED) That is over 1.000% increase in price and if you use your 7GB. in one day as it has happened to several people, your 2.999 shillings will be gone and you will be disconnected for the rest of the month.\n\nAs for Unlimited I took Orange Unlimited (@2.999 they give you 20GB. and after that still unlimited @ 256kbps till the end of the month). For other things I feel really bad for many people who have few money and they find their account always empty or they see thir 10 shillings be taken away the moment they recharge the line.\n\nNow, any question yet WHY AIRTEL IS DOING SO MANY PROMOTIONS?\nI was a Safaricom client and last year Nimehama kwa Airtel because I was tired of the many MONKEY BUSINESS that Safaricom did and the way they conned my money. SURPRISE SURPRISE. Just after few months I moved to Airtel it seems that they started to copy the same kind of cheats as Safaricom did. So, next I\'ll move to Orange for my calls as well (as I did with the DATA connection). It really hurt my stomach when I see a company like Airtel doing these kind of things to poor Kenyans.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel labda mubadilike  la sivyo kwa hapo hampati wateja. Bora kikatwe pesa nyingi kwa mitandao mingine kuliko kupoteza kabisa.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Still waiting for an explanation as to why I haven\'t been able to top up my balance.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I already switched to Orange for the last left unlimited Internet in Kenya and I\'m wondering if there is any reason for me to keep Airtel still. I guess I have to use what is left of my credit airtime and I\'ll move away also my phone number somewhere else. Airtel, you have been a huge disappointment in the last two months!####$$##%NEGATIVE
my airtel line 0736237036 lost network i cant call neither sms also my airtel money account is inaccesible i have been always told to wait for technical team now for two and a half months just wondering what the technical team has been doing and for how long will i be waiting and whether the Airtel network concerns treat all their customers in this manner.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Si tu veux te rendre compte de la gravité de la situation, souscrit 10 mega et vas verifier le compteur de consommation de ton navigateur en faisant seting puis about. TU verra a la fin mysterieuse de tes 10 mega que si tu reverifie le compteur, le flux ne depasse pas 5 mega. ou est le reste dans la nature. c\'est pas serieux pour un reseau qui se veut credible. bref sa finira un jour.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Needed to send money on Airtel Money, days later the recipient hadn\'t received confirmation or notification... called customer care, was told it was a technical hitch, the confirmation would be sent within 24 hours... but still nothing went through... asked to get my money back but was told i would be charged... for a mistake that was evidently Airtel\'s by own admission... Am I supposed to be happy? I doubt... Am I supposed to recommend the service.... very doubtful...####$$##%NEGATIVE
I have started liking Airtel slowly. Unlimited Internet for a day, a week or a month that is really changing my world. Now this Kr2 for 25 minutes, etc. That is really good for me. You are really \"crazy\" !####$$##%POSITIVE
Airtel stop bragging about minutes which never work without distortions. Look at mtn\'s 1 for 4 very brilliant, look at mtn\'s internet very excellent but yoz am even afraid to buy unlimited bundles in my router because they will turn into worst. U claim to be the largest network provide so behave yourselves by improving yo services or else some of us will continue using airtel for receiving calls and mtn for calling####$$##%NEGATIVE

Work on your Blackberry Data Plan. Etisalat BIS Now #1000  and #1500. MTN BIS also just slashed theirs from #3000 to #1500 and that of #1500 to #1000. Both MTN and Etisalat comes with Unlimited Internet surfing and Download. Airtel, Yours is still #1400 and #1200 both with 1GB. Now tell me Airtel, why wont people move to MTN or Etisalat for BIS. Nigerians dont like being limited on their Internet surfing. So, for ur own good Airtel,  do something fast or lose customers on this important service.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Exciting for them because they grab more of your money :-)\nIf you want Unlimited just turn to Orange Unlimited as everybody else has done. 2.999 a month to get 20GB. at superfast speed (instead of the 7GB. Airtel gives you in total or 10GB. in one week for 999 shillings). Not only that, after the 10GB. or 20GB. you still browse and download @256kbps till the end of the period subscribed (week or month). I used to have Airtel Unlimited but they \"BLAZED\" us last month (what a big mistake from Airtel!)\nI turned to Orange last month (like all my friends, in fact they told me about it and I am quite happy about it).\nI used 20GB. in 17 days. Now I browse till May 3rd and download at 256kbps (it is a steady 30 to 32KB. enough to download 2,5GB. per day, browse quickly enough and Skype with camera without problem).\nI still have 12 days unlimited but if I was with Airtel for the same amount of DATA I would have spent already over 10.000 shillings with BLAZE instead of the 2.999 in total I spent. More about the package and FUP here: \n\nhttp://www.orange.co.ke/complex/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=191&Itemid=342#twoj_fragment1-4\n\nPole sana kwa wale wanaoendelea kutupa pesa zao kwa BLAZE ambayo ni toleo la takataka. Airtel, give us back the Unlimited as it was!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Pole Irene. One shilling per day from you, one shilling per day from me, few shillings per day from millions of Kenyans... How much do you think Airtel is stealing per month with these tricks? SHAMEFUL! I have been cheated money as well without permission... that is called stealing. But Airtel, Sufferingcom and other are all thieves in a way or another, you have to find who steals less... POLE!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Bought the one day blaze jana. Got my Eblaze 750mb and that is when my nightmare started. Upto now connection is sooo horrible. If I had known, I\'d have wasted my money elsewhere. As we speak, I have 595mb of data remaining, cant browse, cant send mail, cant attach my invoices, nkt! Mobile internet network ovyo kabisa. Sitawai nunua tena izi bundles. I have learnt my lesson. Safaricom might be expensive but it is effective. Na izo bandali kaeni nazo.####$$##%NEGATIVE

That\'s just it. What\'s the usefulness of a #1000.00 subscription that one can not use sufficiently. Just 1GB or #1,500.00 at 3GB, that\'s not appalling at all.  You must rectify these faults on time before you lose customers. Good day!####$$##%NEGATIVE

For one of the numbers that I made a call to I was charged the normal rate despite it being registered under the so called 254r club. When I called customer service, the lady I was speaking to was coward enough to hang up on me rather than solving the matter. Highly disappointing. Secondly, I am also getting frequently charged for browsing from my account balance despite having subscribed to classic blaze####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel Is still the best Network in Kenya if it comes to cheap calling... you have been told when the subscriptions were done... do your investigations and find out.. You will be shocked to find out it was just you trying to go through the 247 services####$$##%POSITIVE
What about when it takes them 1 week to activate a line? Cheap is very expensive. To worsen the situation they seem to concentrate in apologizing and regretting for the inconvenience caused. that phrase you will get it in a record time. action utangonja ndugu. for sure airtell is far. actually they should re-brand themselves to either roadtel, railtel, snaketel, or snailtel calling themselves airtel is an irony####$$##%NEGATIVE
Mmmh?! Airtel is stl da best. I enjoy its services. Ngesi ayong, rlax braza all wl b well if not nipe ur namba nikuzamazie hiyo credo n m sure they wl nt deduct it as long as u kip ur phone locked fm unauthorised access....digital I min.####$$##%POSITIVE

La 1ère preocupation du client c\'est la qualité du service que vous offrez. C\'est quand meme  frustrant de voir tes Mo fondre comme la neige sous le soleil alors que le debit de transfert de données est tres faible au maxi 20kb/s en ce qui concerne.####$$##%NEGATIVE
So Patrick Mensah u r also facing de same problem l\'ve been facing since monday afternoon, initially l tot it wont last but its been dayz now n its still going on. As for me l av given up on dis. What makes me sick is dat old players have advantage over new players n its not fair at all. Be just Airtel Ghana n let dis game be without cheating####$$##%NEGATIVE
Miss Roccson hmmmmn its clear u n Patrick know wat u r saying. Dis means u r regular player. Airtel is not being just n fair to us. My problem is l introduced three friendz  to dis more cash promo n de funniest tin was dat dey had to leave their old network ie tigo to join airtel because l told dem dat their promo\'s r gud, but with de way de points r coming dey av realized dey do not stand a chance of winning. how much at all does airtel want us to spend to win 2,000. Must we spend 2,000 to win 2,000. lf yes wats de point of playing. we r fed up####$$##%NEGATIVE
U\'r De Best####$$##%POSITIVE
According to Airtel chapter 1 verse 40 it states that, Airtel is number one telecommunication for you to use u and your family friends and relatives. chapter 40 says that when you share or tag airtel modem pixs with friends u win ur self a modem each from Airtel with 2 GB free data. so repent people and turn to or subscribe to Airtel Uganda before it is late \" AMEN\"####$$##%POSITIVE

This will only be funny if u extend up to 24hours, this time is good to talk to loved ones, personally it doesn\'t make sense, you buy and for short period of time its expired, u r stealing from people, and where I\'m in kaputa there is network problems, you buy minutes for 4pin before u start using it network gone and only to have network the following day.... Sometimes I say FYABUPUBA, it really piss me off, mwilatulila amasuku pamutwe.... See what MTN is doing and Zamtel... Awe improve before u loose customers, hear what your customers are asking for, u r behavin like what MMD was behavin while in power, see how skeleton MMD has become now, listen to what we want.... There is no you without us your customers... We want bundles as well####$$##%NEGATIVE

Once I\'m making enquires, it gets to a point and I start getting ignored.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Yesterday I bought daily blaze and by 8 am today had data balance of 23 mb. I have an app (my data manager) which shows I have used 17 mb at the same time I had an airtime credit of ksh 201 on phone, now all my credit of ksh 201 is missing yet I still have a data balance of 6mb. After calling your helpline I\'m being told I used on internet. Even if I use out of bundle, 17mb by ksh 8 does not equal ksh 201. So someone is siphoning my credit and this the second time it happens. Investigate it.\n####$$##%NEGATIVE
I also experience the same, but when I use other ISP\'s on my laptop, it picks again. I think it\'s something to do with the speed or something. Tuchanuliwe pamoja Gakau Njuguna.####$$##%NEGATIVE

your services are wanting. You do not send an sms notification when data bundle is below 2MB and when i try to top up am told i have to exhaust the current bundles first. There is no way to tell if your bundles are over until the system starts munching my airtime so fast and so much that i don\'t have enough to buy new bundles. Borrow a leaf from safaricom. They always warn you when your bundles are low and you can purchase as many times as you want because it is automatically added to the available bundle balance.####$$##%NEGATIVE
I like airtelinterneted.####$$##%POSITIVE
Airtel remains the best compared to other networks, simply becoz they care most to an odinary man, u can just imagine calling friends on other networks for only three bob without even asingle cent being stollen from your remaining credit. Thumps up for airtel their network is all over in kenya apart from turkana n the suround places, so if u r in that place u can complain n i hope they r planing to adress that isue once n for all. welcome n g9t know that airtel yatubeba.####$$##%POSITIVE

Airtel c\'est vraiment de la merde , il y a rien meilleur comme offre , ce sont tous des offres à la con . Vous ne pensez qu\'à vos benefices .

Moi y compris!!\r\nNous préferons utiliser telma et orange , on beneficie encore plus avec ces autres operateurs serieux!!!\r\nEn plus d\'etre con et nul comme reseau , il fait aussi chier avec ces offres de merde!!! Pfff\r\nvous savez quoi ? J\'etais parmis vos clients , j\'etais trop fidele ... , Enfin toutes ma famille etait vos clients .. Mais la , je crois que c\'est le contraire!!!\r\nPuis , je me dis que vous faites rien de bon , meme pas donner des petits cadeaux a vos clients qui etaient toujours fidele avec airtel. Ma famille fait des abonnements avec airtel depuis deja des annees , et meme pas un stylo comme cadeau . Pfff au contraire avec orange , mon oncle a fait des abonnements pendant 2ans , rien que 2ans et il a eu un cadeau pour sa fidelité . Un telephone portable comme cadeau . Mais aveec airtel , RIEN . RIEN du tout!!!!!!!!!!! Vous ne pensez qu\'a vos benefices!!! Allez vous faire foutre!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

The call from Airtel to all other numbers is not going through. The handset is trying to connect then all over sudden it displays \'disconnected\' message. Similar sentiments were echoed by somebody whose efforts to reach me turned futile. After several trials she managed to reach me, by then I was on my way to Embu. This problems are at Embu town & its environ. My contact is 0734920980. Thankyou####$$##%NEGATIVE

Nktest Airtel without fear and ready to defend this any where am customer number 0733220043 there is no single service tht airtel offers thts good not evn one am a very disapointed person.####$$##%NEGATIVE
Subscribers BE aware! The tosha bundles are ONLY valid from midnight to 6 PM. If you subscribe during the day for instance, it will assume you subscribed at midnight so it will count even the hours you have not used. At exactly 5.59 PM the bundles will have expired whether you used them or not. If you check your balance at this time they will still be there but you will not be able to use them. During this time anything you do will be charged from your available airtime.  Do not browse past 6pm thinking that you are utilizing the tosha bundles coz it will drain your airtime faster than you can blink. who wakes up at midnight to buy tosha bundles anyway?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Plz plz Airtel,,today hve spent twice wht i spend a day,,bcz yu‘ve dne away with tha bonus bundle,,,plz plz do me tht favour,,,its becomin increasingly expensiv fo me...thnx!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Am in regrets ever taking your services. \n\nI also regret ever bought my fone from your funny and not serious customer care reps. \n\nAietel Kenya must knw tht safaricom has given me wat they could not offer me in the last two years. \n\nYours faithfully\n\nNixon Haya \n0733220043.####$$##%NEGATIVE

And I have been asking u to solve this problem so many times but nothing has been done to help me accept giving me fake settings: I have a lumian 510 with yo locked in simcard,i can\'t access internet yet I brought it to one of yo service points for internet settings(didnt work) but what puzzles me is that whenever I buy data you take it off without me using it then u send me a msg mbu my bundle has expired!

From mombasa-forget it bro n chill.\nThey have the worst customer care personals who dont know thier job they are employed for.\nI redeemed my ziada points for airtime twice last year but to no avail.It\'s 9 months now n I suppose they are still investigating like a suspense murder mystery.\nThen I recharged a 50/= card but it did not activate, the care help line cannot assist till a personal visit is paid.Imagine for 50/= you spend 300/= on fuel or 50/= on matatu + 50/= on a parking ticket + lose half day from work & above all Risk car break in the parking area.\nThis is called business n we should learn from this how become A MILLIONAIRE faster.\nThis is why they have not opened any of their outlets here in any supermarkets or malls .\nThis is to make things difficult for their customers to reach them in person, because they know they will have longer queues after working hours than the normal hours.####$$##%NEGATIVE

At that time, I recharged N3000 and was also credited with N300 bonus.\r\nI however was unable to use my fone, though the fone was with me throughout.\r\nAt about 3.30pm same day, i got a network message sayin my acct balance was N1333 (almost N1700 gone). I quickly checked my bonus & remaining 40MB were also gone despite not makin any calls off net.\r\n\nSecond case:\r\non Monday evening (20th may) i had N1203, then i recharged N500 thus i had N1703.\r\nI subscribed to BCM (N1400) and had N303 left. Not quite long i got a message tellin me my account balance is N0.00. My recharge and subscription bonuses were all gone even though i never made any calls.\r\nN303 and N1667 all gone.

Hello,\r\nyesterday I subscribed to Tosha 20 and this was the confirmation message;\r\n\nYou have successfully bought  Tosha 20 one day plan of 45 min airtel to airtel 5 mins to other networks 20 SMS & 20 MB data. Dial *767*5# to check balance\r\n\nthe first test I did was to surf but all in vain; failed to connect to internet!\r\n\nThen I called a different network, the response was; I got insufficient funds!\r\n\nLastly I called an Airtel number, it didnt work!\r\n\nNow, where is the 20 MB bundles since it failed to connect to internet, the 5 minutes to other networks and the 45 minutes to Airtel number?!\r\nWhy do you give your customers a new product which is not compatible, half baked and not working?\r\nAre you sure that Airtel SIM card is all we need??\r\nCan you return my 20/= please..... Please!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtell, do you really know that if you continue this way, without a resonable improvement in your services, the quality of your service, making it possible for your customers to have a short service code with which they can reach your customer service center, correcting you billing system and so on, you definately will see a lot of your customers POTTING to other networks which has a better quality offers for them.

Prix exact chez Airtel : 417.000f cfa sans abonnement (mais 386.000f au centre ville, magasin iShop car je l\'ai eu là). De plus, l\'abonnement n\'est plus nécessaire pour avoir bbm, un wifi ou une connexion normale sur internet suffit pour bénéficier de tous les services. Malheureusement, depuis que Airtel a mis en place son système pourri de cartes de recharges internet, on ne peut plus s\'abonner via internet en envoyant Net500 au 368 comme avant. Réseau de merde...!!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel Zambia why is your internet so expensive. I paid kr300 for unlimited internet only to be told that I\'ve reached 90% of my usage which by then was about 6gb. what the hell! last time I got kr15 for a day and I reached about 2gb. honestly are u being fair boss? this is why Africa will always lag behind in IT with exorbitant charges like these. when u deem it unlimited please let it be so. I really believe airtel is the most expensive in Zambia in terms of internet. very upset user.####$$##%NEGATIVE
My query was that i bought credit three days ago for KR20. I have not made any calls or sms\'s but you are deducting KR0.5 everyday. Also note that i am not subscribed to any services such as Whatsapp. I made the query 30 mins ago on which people contributed but it has been removed by yourselves. I need an explanation before i make a formal complaint.####$$##%NEGATIVE

First of all why is accessing internet services in Kenya a luxury that only a few can afford? The same with wi-fi services. Airtel u should come up with efficient and pocket friendly bundles esp. with introduction of fibre optic cables. In fact the President spoke of rolling out of WI-FI in major towns within the next five years. Wonder how this will happen when u cant even tackle such small issues(?)####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel really is a pathetic service provider. I subscribe to their internet bundles, but i never get a notification that my bundle has expired. This ensures my airtime gets used! When customer care  is contacted they state that management has policies in place to ensure that notifications are not sent!!!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Merci! je pense que le forfait internet est plutôt lié à la carte sim plutôt qu\'au téléphone portable car j\'avais activé le forfait mois sur un Sony Xpéria S et j\'ai ensuite mis ma carte sim dans le blackberry Z10, ce qui m\'a permis de bénéficier de la connexion internet pendant 1 mois. mais depuis l\'annonce des cartes de recharge internet, il se trouve que je n\'arrive pas à renouveler mon forfait mois quel que soit le téléphone que j\'utilise (directement via Net500 au 368). Sur le Z10 j\'ai effectivement configuré le point d\'accès manuellement (internet.ga.zain.com) et la solution marche, sauf qu\'elle consomme énormément de crédit si on ne prend pas un abonnement mensuel et qu\'on se laisse facturer à la consommation.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Zain is dis how u people make ur profit by stealing peoples airtime, if someone takes ur airtime loan and probably loads after then, instead of u to take the actual amount the customer used, u will rather take the full amount borrowed irespective of de amount, even after u had deducted ur interest. This is stealing and on several occassions u people have stolen my airtime tro dis means, remember u did not start dis package with dis method and if u have changed pattern why don\'t u inform ur users on de new development instead of just taking de decision and just implement. Dats poor customer service. I need u people to return all my stolen airtime, remember it does not speak well of ur reputable organization and it dosent give u a healthy competitio.####$$##%NEGATIVE

You can sue them, the only evidence u need is the airtime cards that used to load airtime on yo phone, u must also be knowing the time at which u loaded yo AT plus internet bundle. You can win dis case 100% and they wil have to compensate u not less than 50M. Go ahead and sue them!####$$##%NEGATIVE

every time i top up credit i find it is less buy few cent for example i had shs1.40 as credit on phone i wanted to make a call so i topped up with sh20 to make the call once i loaded the credit i checked to know what my total balance was, the total to this simple arithmetic would have been Shs21.40 but to my surprise it was Shs20.01 my curiosity to check the balance was necessitated by the fact that i have noticed that every time i top up the sum of existing balance plus the credit bought does not add up, you take advantage of the fact that no one checks the balance they have before they top up, i have all the necessary evidence to prove this\n\nanother thing i have noticed with you is that at times i make a call and the receiver does not pick the call because either the receiver is off network coverage or for some reason doesn\'t pick the phone, and although the call doesn\'t go to voice mail it terminates by it self what follows is the USSD message advising me that my call cost is some few shillings/ or cents\ni might sound petty complaining about few shillings or cent even but if this is what you do to all your clients the in a day you fraud us millions of shillings illegitimately\nSTOP ROBBING US OUR HARD EARNED CASH #SomeOneTellAirtelKenya####$$##%NEGATIVE

Bring back reloaded magic numbers # 3 this time around. Improve your customer care by employing more people. Your network for phones that have branded network 2G n 3G changes 2 much 2 2G even in areas u would not expect it to change. The interest for that loan should not b there no need since u no u will get u tt at the first top up unless if u give us a certain duration in which to pay n use the tt. Also improve customer relations then reduce the voting for BBA to 1k then I will vote for her otherwise let her come back n cry for u for making her early eviction possible 2k is 2 much for an ordinary customer who came up with that amount.####$$##%NEGATIVE

You get us covered with breaking 3G service? Go to the city of globacom and learn what it is to maintain 3.5G service - steady, fast and seamless. Your 3G, like Nigerian power supply, comes and goes every second, turning to edge, 3.5G that will not connect at all for hours, etc. Since 9 days ago, your internet service has been regrettably debasing, where we have to use glo to finish your unfinishd job. You can only boast in Kogi where MTN is a suckling in terms of internet service. Elsewhere, Airtel is nothing. Remember, your name is only written in sand in Nigeria, having changed your name a millionfold in the past. People no longer believe you. And the medium through which you would have got relevance - 3.7G service - is worse than 1.5G. Wake up!####$$##%NEGATIVE

Their so-called BB unlimited is all a lie and fake- maybe they don\'t understand English. I did bb subscription last week, they took my 1500 but refused activating my plan. After about 6days and 20times calling, they later refunded back my money -which they even start deducting without them activating my plan.......... After this month, guys am running to MTN or ETIsalat for BB plan\n####$$##%NEGATIVE

Today I deposited money in my airtel money account hoping to send to different people. Try as I may I could not send and kept getting some text about invalid format and that I should call 111, which I did (order no. 850331). I was advised to wait and also reset my password, which I did. I still could not send the money and had to withdraw the cash and send via mpesa. Long and short of it is airtel made away with my KShs. 165 (145/= for withdrawal and 20/= for password change). How\'s that for customer service?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Whats happening to the Tosha bundles? Is it so hard for you to inform us that the bundles are not working? How fair is it that you take our money, fail to deliver and go ahead to bury your heads in the sand! Are you operating professionaly? How do you advertise a service that does not work? We need answers and refunds!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Why not just reducing your filthy charges other than talking unproductive things!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Ine nde I enjoy Airtel money koopsa, Just improve on the availability of network because most of Airtel money dealers complain kuti ur network is unreliable otherwise airtel money ndi deal!####$$##%NEGATIVE
Much as i enjoy with airtel money but you can do better more than that like availability of the agents is just low & network availability is poor. another concern is of blackberry internet 3.75G services is just very poor- please we\'re losing our hard earned money to purchase BB internet service only to be given a raw deal. AIRTEL YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS, pls improve. On a lighter note, whats your moto?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Sorry sir, I think you will be better off checking the other networks.

The flunctuating nature of the Airtel data service is very discouraging and frustrating. For example, when you switch the phone on, you will first see edge. Later on, u wl see 3G. After about twenty seconds, it wil be edge again. Give that edge some seven seconds, there will be no data service at all for about three minutes. And when the 3G resumes, it will not connect. And when it is ready to work, it moves with the speed of electricity or lightning. That means, it wil be super fast. So, i wish Airtel could maintain a seamless, undulating 3G data service like glo. Thank you as you repair the service in Lokoja, Kogi State.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Good Morning Airtel, This is to inform you that you are the poor network so far in Nigeria, You will call with Airtel and the person you are calling will not hear what you are saying and before you know it, you have removed your money immediately, My mom Evangelist kikelomo Alo loaded 2,000 naira Airtel and she used 1000 naira for internet data plan you guyz removed 1000 naira and you sent her a confirmation text msg telling her she as subcription for 260MB, After that she try to make calls with her cell phone and she found out that you have removed all the 2000 naira. She put a call through your customer care so many times telling them what happen but you guyz keep telling her you will refund her money over 1 week now,  you have not done anything about it, I want you to know that all your conversations with her on the phone is recorded, well for your information\'s it is not every body in nigeria that is a fool, we know our right and you will hear from her lawyer soon. And this shall be reported to all TV stations in Nigeria. You will be invited to the Court.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Nos inquiétudes sur la qualité défaillantes du réseau de Airtel ont été confirmées hier par le chef d\'antenne de l\'OTRT à Abéché. Cette mauvaise qualité du réseau est due à des nombreuses failles techniques et ce qui vient accentuer nos soucis c\'est qu\'il ne sera pas facile d\'y remédier dans un meilleur délai.Pire les sanctions et amendes infligées pour cette mauvaise qualité du réseau ne sont pas honorées par Airtel. Ce qui veut dire qu\'ils nous sucent les crédits et ne payent pas les amendes.Tant pis pour nous...####$$##%NEGATIVE

Hi Gustav, airtel supa star promo is a point based promotion. airtel continues to reward loyal customers and supa star is one such way of doing that. You accumulate more points, the more active you are on the network. Simply dial *450# anytime to check the amount of points you\'ve got. Thanks and enjoy your weekend, Guzzie ;-)####$$##%NEGATIVE

I have been using Airtel (previously known as Celtel and Zain) for over 15 years now. \n\nI must admit that your internet has turned into something ridiculous over the past few months. The internet speed is so slow that most of the times - the connection times out and I have to just let go of the download.\n\nI strongly believe the data bundles you provide are just another way of making good money. I always but a weekly bundle of Tsh. 6,000 which used to give me 3GB (changed to 2GB from last week)... since the internet speed is slow... I usually have lots of unused data which sometimes is around 1.2GB... BUT... as soon at its 5am... airtel writes off all my data bundles which is veryy depressing because my bundles expire in the afternoon. Interestingly, they wont let me buy new bundles until my current bundles expire... which means I am on \'pay as you use\' for internet.\n\nWhy are yoy guys doing this???####$$##%NEGATIVE
Hii campun yenu ilikuwa safi sana, ila kuna mahali mlizembea, mteja akilalamika hamjali, makato yenu si sawa, mkachelewa kuweka akaunt ya pesa, kwa sababu mitandao yote watu wanalalamika na nyie mlikuwa wa kwanza jirekebisheni, watu wengi watarudi simu ya mezani, bank kwa ajili ya kuhifadhi pesa.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Il faut arrêter de bleuffer les gens. Je suis actuellement à Biltine et j\'ai de la peine à appeler sur le réseau Airtel pire encore sur celui du Tigo.

J\'attire l\'attention de chacun de vous, soyons fan de nous même pour une meilleure communication entre nous sans problème de réseau ou de réseau indisponible####$$##%NEGATIVE

J\'attire l\'attention de chacun de vous, soyons fan de nous même pour une meilleure communication entre nous sans problème de réseau ou de réseau indisponible####$$##%NEGATIVE
voila pour montrer a ces gens que AIRTEL est conscient de ce qu elle dit vous me donnés le credit de 10 000f pour preuve####$$##%POSITIVE

You guys are very inserious and must think we\'re idiots. Why call it unlimited when the download rate is reduced at some point thus preventing us from downloading just anything? I used to download files as big as 6Gb but now I can barely download past 2gb. When you brought back unlimited internet I was so excited that I decided to give you guys another chance since I had stopped using you services. Now I see I shouldn\'t have bothered at all.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Well, you might be the lucky one, pls let\'s know if and when they credit u back.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Problèmes de réseau de téléphonie mobile au Tchad: Escroquerie ou simples fripouilles, les tchadiens abonnés de Airtel ou Tigo sont confrontés à des sérieux problèmes de réseau.Le fait d\'appeler un ami ou une connaissance ou même un membre de votre famille est devenu aujourd\'hui un exercice contraignant voir même décourageant. Les deux sociétés de téléphonie mobile ont atteint le summum de ridicule et sans aucune piété continuent aisément à nous soutirer de l\'argent alors que ils sont incapables de fournir un service acceptable selon les normes requises. A Abéché et à Biltine, c\'est le pire de pire. Sur 10 appels entrants à peine 1 seul est probable. Le taux d\'échec est de 99% voir même 100%. A cela s\'ajoutent des publicités mensongères qui nous sont destinées à longueur des journées dans le seul but de nous amadouer sans tenir compte de nos besoins réels. S\'il vous plait AIRTEL et TIGO faites un peu mieux pour nous rendre notre vie un peu heureux. Déjà Eau et Electricité nous accablent avec trop des problèmes. Faites mieux...####$$##%NEGATIVE
AIRTEL veut juste que les internautes passent sa publicité c\'est tout. c\'est de l\'ESCROQUERIE pure et simple.####$$##%NEGATIVE

I don’t know of these ‘free’ minutes because personally I get charged. I have emailed and called customer care but I have never got a satisfactory answer. The excuse was that they were charging me for whatsapp, seriously??? At some point I turned off all my data exchange connections but the charges continued. Unfortunately, I am too busy to find time to visit your offices but am contemplating logging a formal complaint with ZICTA copying all our correspondences so far. Honestly I have tried to be mature and professional about it even though it’s my money at loss.####$$##%NEGATIVE

How would u feel if someone buys a chip today n loads it with 50pesewas credit n later walks away with a brand new BMW. Is that what loyalty is? Is that what customers want?

Ur charges r too high! Y not charge 60ngwee? Ul c how much more noney ul make. To attract a bigger crowd, u hav to THINK! The bad part is u want to exploit people all the time by getting larger chunks of money from them at one goal. For ur own info, take a look at the crowd and see how many rich fellow u have. Everyone wants to vote for SULU, but if someone gets K1 airtime in a day, how wil s/he do that?####$$##%NEGATIVE

your internet connection has been slow of late, speeds rarely go beyond 15kb/s, just about two months ago it used to go to 1mb/s, when i have sibscribed to daily unlimited. just a few days ago i subscribed to daily unlimited and then you switched to free internet between midnight and 7am, which was slow and erratic, i hardly used half of my alloted 500mb. i am even skeptical on buying weekend bundles. where is the 3.7G you promise us?####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel, il ne suffit pas de creer de nouveausx forfaits. Ca ne sert a rient si on ne peut meme pas ouvrir une bonne page avec. Il faut au contraire ameliorer ce qui est deja la. Votre 3.75G n\'est que du nom seulement. On ne peut meme pas tenir une vitesse de 10kbps pour 1 minute. Ca ne fait que zigzaguer entre 1, 3, 5, 8kbps. Ca ne vaux meme pas 2G.

Boycottons Airtel Tchad, il est anormal que cette compagnie téléphonique ayant plus de deux millions d\'abonnés, occupant une place très importante dans le marché des télécoms au Tchad, arnaque la population tchadienne avec des prix excessivement chers, prenons le coût de la connexion internet qui est de 60000 Fcfa par mois, pour un accès à bas debit, et honnêtement lent, acessible qu\'à une faible distance et périmètre, alors qu\'en France le coût est relativement presque gratuit, mois de dix euros par mois et encore la concurrence s\'etripe, soit moins de 5000 Fcfa par mois, ne parlons même pas des coûts de la communication telephonique, c\'est aberrant et malhonnête de la part d\'une grosse compagnie qui se dit ouverte à la société, de pratiquer de tels prix à l\'insue des tchadiens, alors que seulement 0,4 % de la population tchadienne a accès au réseau internet. Au moment où le gouvernement tchadien participe à l\'élaboration d\'un projet de la fibre optique afin de favoriser l\'accès à internet dans tout le territoire national, Airtel Tchad refuse d\'y collaborer en maintenant les mêmes prix. Je ne pense pas, mais je suis même sûre qu\'il revient de droit aux tchadiens de revandiquer une baisse radicale des prix afin de connecter la jeunesse tchadienne entière au monde de l\'électronique et de l\'internet. #boycottons airtel. Partagez cette article dans le bien de l\'intérêt public.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Je rencontre trop de difficultées: 1) Je consomme mais mes points de fidilté Airtel n\'augmente; 2) j\'ai payé ma facture d\'eau avec airtel money, on m\'a bien signifié que ma facteur a été bien reglée avec un accusé et le lendemain je compose mon solde airtel money et rien n\'a changé. j\'ai appelé le service clientel pour savoir si ma facture a été bien reglé et comment et qui a promis de resoudre le problème mais je n\'ai pas eu de suite. 3) J\'ai failli  dormir dans une alimentation pour avoir payer des biens avec airtel money qui ne marchait pas et je n\'avais pas des assez de jetons. 4) je ne suis pas content de votre nouvelle facturation des megabites dont on a du mal a comprendre d\'ailleurs;5) ma clé de connection ne marche pas dans mon quartier (Karpala)or pourtant ca marche bien en province quand j\'y rend. je pense que c\'est bon d\'abord et je compte sur vous.

Mimi ninawauliza airtel hivi inakuwaje? kila siku mnanikata hela kwenye namba  (0786791939) nikijiunga na kifurushi cha mwezi mnakata 300 kila siku na sasa najiunga na kifurushi cha wiki  mnakata kila tsh 103 na wala sijajiunga na huduma yoyote inakuwaje?####$$##%NEGATIVE
Jose ntandu nimekukubali, Hahahahaaaaa dah we ni nomaaaaaaah, ila kweli some times huwezi kutak kushinda kwa nguvu lazma utokwe jasho ndipo ushinde ila hata hivyo washiriki wako wengi sana ukizingatia asilimia 99% ya watanzania wanamilik cm hata kama kuna mitandao mingine siku hzi kila m2 anatumia line 2 mpaka 3 au 4 kulingana na miofa inayotolewa na mitandao yte nchini lakini ukweli utabaki kuwa pale pale kwenye chaguo lako kulingana na mtandao unayoipenda mfano mi binafsi nina line zte 4 LAKINI airtel ni kiboko ya mitandao hapa nchini kulingana na huduma zinazopatikana kwenye mtandao wake, sina takwimu nzuri kwa sasahiv kujua ni mtandao gani unaongoza kwa kuwa na wateja wengi zaidi, lakini airtel kwa mwono wangu hawa wanaweza kuongoza kwasasahiv but kw mtu yeyote anaetumia mitandao ni lazma ujaribu tu bahati yako sio unaforce tu eti upewe ushindi never come kwenye 45 milioni ya watanzania airtel haiwez kuwatunza zawadi wt hao hata Vodacom au tigo au mtandao unayoijua wew####$$##%NEGATIVE
Merci Airtel!####$$##%POSITIVE
Nataka huduma ya airtel yatosha inagoma kuunganisha####$$##%POSITIVE
Airtel acheni ubaguzi kwenye zawadi mbona sijasikia mkoa wa Tabora katoka mshindi,naomba katika zawadi ya sh1,000,000/= ya kila siku kwanini msiigawe kwa watu 50 kila siku wakapata 20,000/=kuliko kupewa mmoja na haeleweki au mnalipana wafanyakazi wa airtel tu mbona hatu sikii wanao shinda hiyo milioni, mjaribu kuwa wakweli na mhudumie wateja wenu.####$$##%NEGATIVE

moi egalement j\'en ai acheté mais  je n\'ai pas vu de mega et depuis une semaine je n\'ai pas reçu les bonus consecutifs à l\'ouverture de mon compte airtelmoney.on peut m\'expliquer un peu?####$$##%NEGATIVE
kwanza, Hongereni sana Airtel kwa huduma zenu nzuri sana. Hii huduma ni nzuri sana, kwa sababu, Wakati mwingine unahitaji tu kuwasiliana na Mtu kwa sms na inakulazimu kujiunga na Yatosha, lakini sasa ni basi tena si lazima tena.  Siku zote kila jambo likitokea kuna Watu wataipenda na kuna Wengine wataichukia.  Hawo wanaochukia wana sababu zao binafsi, kwa sababu, Hakuna Mtu anayelazimishwa kujiunga na Huduma yeyote. Ni Maamuzi ya Mtu, aidha ajiunge ama asijiunge, so Msiwasikilize wapinzani.   Mimi ombi langu ni kwamba, Jitahidini kuwa Watendaji wa Mnachokitangaza kwa Wateja Wenu, nimesema hili kwa sababu, Airtell Wanatangaza kwamba Ukinunua Modem ya Internet ya Airtel, utapata Internet ya Bure ya 8GB utakayotumia kwa mda wa Mwezi mzima. Mimi nilishanunua Modem mda wa Mwezi mmoja uliyopita na Sikupata Ofa hiyo, niliwauliza Wahudumu wa Airtel hapo Makao Makuu ya Airtel Zanzibar City na ndiyo walioniuzia na Walinijibu kwamba nitakuja kuichukua Laini hiyo ya Promotion siku inayofuata, nilifuatilia wakasema njoo Next day, Mpaka sasa hawajanipa. So Jijahidini kuwa Watendaji wa Mnachokitangaza msije kuwa Wadanganyifu.  Katika pia Wahudumu, Lazima wawe na Upendo kwa Wateja wao na Watoe Huduma kwa kuonyesha Nyuzo za Furaha kwa Wateja Wao. Pia Wanapo pokea Simu ya Mteja, Wajitahidi kusikiliza Matatizo ya Wateja na Wafanyie kazi si kupuuza. Best Regards for All.####$$##%POSITIVE

La connexion internet de Airtel est devenu très lente par rapport au lancement de la 3.75G on dirait vos équipements ne supportent pas une grandes quantités d\' abonnés et auparavant je faisais de lecture de vidéos sur YouTube même pendant la journée mais pour le moment ça devenu impossible de faire le streaming (lecture en ligne) même le page Facebook sur mobile prend du temps pour se télécharger or c\'était à un seul clic. Attention votre conçurent VDC vient de lancé une forte promotion Internet via fibre optique et il a augmenter le volume de forfait son expression du moment ou slogan est surfer à la vitesse d\' éclair , je sais bien que vous sachiez ce que veut dire éclair donc la vitesse de la lumière même si vous aussi vous signerez le contrat avec SCPT pour l\' exploitation de la fibre optique mais VDC en fait le premier donc le leadership se mérite. En effet nous avons besoin d\' une connexion sérieuse pas de gigantesque pub pour une connexion lente là nous changerons de Cap.####$$##%NEGATIVE

You have deliberately limited us to write on your wall. Hahahaha...this is strange. This is bad. Airtel, You are gradually losing it all. Dont be deceived by the number of likes cos the same way it shot up, the same way it will come down. You like it when customers are dissatisfied. You dont want to be criticised yet u dont do the right thing. Now u dont want people to tell you what their grievances are so people will resort to telling one another how awful some of your schemes are.####$$##%NEGATIVE

Airtel please look Into the BIS bundle you give us.. How can you be giving 100MB for limited subscription @ the Rate of 400naira while  Glo and MTN are giving nothing less than 500MB @ the same rate. Stop reaping us off our hard earned money. \r\nSecondly, i subscribed unlimited, all for Airtel to swap all my bundle within 2hours of subscriptions with the excuse of i downloaded more than 300MB... Why is it called unlimited if i can\'t boastfully download worth of 500MB? I used to think ds ntwrk is the Best but am totally far frm the truth. PlSssssssss stop exploiting US.

\"I bought an air Tel sim card (0757 888 257) some time last year because I wanted to ease and broaden my communication. Some how I was not using it regularly. Then last week I chose to have it online 24hrs daily.\n\nOn Friday, I loaded air time of ugx 2000, then I loaded Kika of Ugx 500, leaving me with Ugx1502 as available balance. However, on 5/7/2013 at 23:02, I received a message from air tel that I have received 25 minutes to call 7.2 million people. But just like any thief, the message did not state when those minutes would expire. I immediately checked my air time balance and it was reading Ugx 1502 as before. So I thought of someone one to call. I called 0751264904. The\ncall only lasted for 8 minutes and 16 seconds and it was cut off saying my KIKA minutes are finished.\n\nThe following day at 12:48 I received another unsolicited message from airtel saying \"You have received 7 minutes of KIKA....\" Again without stating the expiry time. When I checked my air time balance it read UGX 2. I did not bother to use these minutes up to now....\"####$$##%NEGATIVE
