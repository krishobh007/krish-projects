    method for these charges or, if your designated payment method fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us. Further, you authorize
    and direct us to retain information about the payment method(s) associated with your account. If we do not receive payment from your designated payment
    method or any other payment method on file, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. You will be responsible for accrued but unpaid charges,
    even if your account is canceled by you or terminated by us. During any free trial or other promotion, if any, you will still be responsible for any
    purchases and surcharges incurred using your account.
</p>
<p>

    attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.

    allow to use your account (including your children, family, friends, or any other person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains
    access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your username, password, or other authentication credentials or information.
</p>
<p>
    VI. WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF WARRANTIES.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not completely satisfied with the Service, your sole remedy is that you may cancel at any time on 30 days advanced notice. If you cancel
    properly, and cease to use the Service, you will not be charged any additional amounts after the effective date of such termination, but you will be
    responsible for any and all charges and activity accrued prior to such date. Company undertakes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
    information it provides is current and accurate. However, Company does not warrant the accuracy of information. Company also undertakes commercially
    reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of any confidential information you provide, in accordance with the privacy policy stated on the Company

    NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF US TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE, EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES
    PAID TO US BY YOU DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE OF ANY CLAIM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS AN ESSENTIAL TERM
